"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",1.0,depression
"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",1.0,depression

People will parrot empty platitudes: ""The 40s are the new 30s!"", ""When you're 70 you'll give everything to go back to being 30!"" But the truth is I let my sexual prime go by. I let what should've been the best years of my life go by. What's the point of starting over now?

The despair, the heaviness, the tight chest. I just can't cry and that's okay. Not crying doesn't mean we're not experiencing depression.

Always waking up at 2am onwards and continuously being awaken from there. Drank so much coffee to stay awake and have naps on the bus or trains. After years of doing this and supressed. Having my very first panic attack at 20(I didnt even know it was a panic attack, my friend had to explain to me about it) after someone I loved passed. I used to think panic attack are fakes and you’re easily able to recover quickly from it. Funny how I thought I would commit suicide at 21 but didn’t go through with it. My body finally cracked at 22. Slowly starting to lose it after years of suppression. My anxiety gotten worst and every day after waking up I feel so so so tired. Never felt energise for a long time. It draining. I feel drain. Went to the mental hospital, gave me some meds (anti-depressants and some sedation for my anxiety/panic attack). I hate getting help but I finally voiced out.

"I've officially hit my rock bottom I've always had a rough go at life and now I'm at my breaking point. I'm doing my best to not hurt, but I am struggling so bad. 

My partner and I just ended our 5 year relationship, I thought he was the one. I gave everything I had and then some into what we were building. 

We have lived and worked together for most of our relationship. Everything was going good until he developed a very close relationship with one of our coworkers. We supported her while she was being cheated on by her husband and my partner has been having a relationship with her for the past 2 months or so. (That I know of)

I am absolutely devastated. I have never loved someone so much and I was the perfect partner to him. I thought I had finally found a good one. I can't believe how wrong I was.

Looking back, I was constantly making so many sacrifices. It was so hard on me, being chronically ill, working the busier (and longer) shifts at work, took care of the household and paid for almost everything. I paid most of the rent and bills every month (even though he made more hourly), purchased all of our furniture and most of his clothing and personal items. I basically set him up to be able to have his affair while I paid for it with my money and health. 

I'm going to be starting my new chapter, but I am at such a loss. Losing my partner and best friend, and I will probably be quitting a job I love because I don't think it will be good for me to work with him and his new woman, who I considered a friend. We officially ended our relationship tonight and his new woman immediately changed her Facebook name and dropped her ex-husband's name. They insist nothing is going on, but everyone at work knows.

I know he is going to leave me. We have been dating 2months and i already think I can't live without him anymore. Every day I feel us growing further apart and it hurts me so much. Right now we see once in a week because he have to work. Last night was terrible. I felt so sad but I couldn't tell him. I did my best to hide it. Few times he asked if I am okay. We Didn't have sex. Maybe he finally realized how ugly and disgusting I am. He woke up really early and said he is going to leave because he didnt sleepy well.

Now all I think is about ""giving up"". I hope I go to heaven. I am a nice person and i have a lots of love to give. Pregabalin is my only hope. Medicine. Wish me luck.

"I have zero friends because I do not trust anyone at all I know a lot of people say that usually people with no friends on the problem, however sometimes it’s not the case. I have people pleasing tendencies and can come across way too kind which has attracted so many narcissists since I was very young. People constantly trying to befriend me even though they secretly dislike me, asking me to borrow them money then never paying me back. And when I eventually cut them off I am stalked, harassed and talked about online. Every personal thing ive told them gets ‘exposed’. It happened to me 4 times alone this year. Now I told myself I never ever want to be friends again with ANYONE. Even if someone doesn’t have bad intentions I honestly can’t take the risk. I am kinda known in my area as I am a creative so this is stressful, I never have anyone to help me take content for work or never have anyone to come with my to a shows or events (which is ok because my supporters come) I’m honestly not sad about being lonely because I am very introverted but ive been at home the past month doing absolutely nothing, no bookings have came my way, absolutely nothing.

"tired of being me 
It's been years since I started feeling horrible about myself. I hate my body and my personality more than anything. I despise my existence and hate being alive. Sometimes this feeling goes away, but it always comes back. Since June, I’ve noticed I’m getting worse, feeling worse every day, and even hallucinating daily, whether at school or at home. To make things worse, I had to stop going to therapy due to financial reasons, and I don’t even need to say how much that made everything worse.  
I simply can’t take it anymore.  
Two friends, whom I deeply care about, have distanced themselves from me, and I also end up isolating myself from everyone. I feel extremely alone. Every time this feeling comes, I feel lonely, but at least I used to have people around me, like virtual friends I used to play games or chat with. Now, I truly feel alone. Everyone has grown up and started building their lives, while I’m still here, unable to move.  
On top of that, I don’t know what I want to do with my life. I’m 17, in my last year of high school, and I have no idea what I want to do. Since I was a child, I’ve dreamed of becoming a doctor, but in my current state, I know I don’t have the competence to get into medical school, as I barely have the strength or focus to get out of bed. No matter how much I try to study, I simply can’t. It’s as if my mind is melting more and more every second. I can’t focus, no matter how hard I try. I’ve thought about a more realistic option, like pharmacy, but even that course is very competitive, and as much as I like the field, it’s not my dream.  
I study at a private school (i got a huge scholarship), but it’s not very good. I hate saying this because I don’t want to sound like I’m complaining about nothing, but I live in a small town, and hardly anyone here gets into highly competitive courses, even those who study tirelessly. This also demotivates me a lot because it feels like it doesn’t matter if I study – I won’t get into anything, just like no one else does. I see my classmates, who are financially better off than me, taking all sorts of extra courses, while I only have school. I see people from other places doing great prep courses, and I know I can’t compete with that.  
I feel apathetic and anxious every day, and I think I’m going to end up alone forever.  
I’m turning 18 in December, and I don’t know how to deal with that. I feel too old to be loved and I’m freaking out because I’m turning 18. In my mind, having been abused by pedophiles online, I feel like I only have “worth” for being underage, as if I’ll lose all my value after that. Another thing that affects me is thinking that if I ever get a boyfriend, he’ll be my first in everything, but I won’t be his first in anything. I feel so behind and immature compared to my friends.  
Sometimes I feel like my best friend is really mean to me, putting me down and everything, but maybe that’s just self-sabotage on my part, like I’m too sensitive. I know she’s going through a lot as well.  
I feel bad for being like this, especially because of my parents. They do so much for me, and I know they love me a lot, but even though my mom has had depression (she was even hospitalized for it), they don’t understand what’s happening with me. I know it must be hard to pay for school for someone who barely does the minimum. I’ve been like this for so many years.  
I just wish someone would take care of me, genuinely care about me, understand me, and love me unconditionally. Someone who would finally be afraid of losing me. I feel like Clarice Lispector when she wrote: “my darkest wish was to hand over my head for someone else to guide; for someone to tell me every day: today, do this, today, cut this, today, perfect this, this is good, this is bad. A person who wanted to ‘take my direction’ would be welcome... I never know if I want to rest because I’m really tired or if I want to rest to give up.""  
I wish I could completely disappear, to be able to forget and end my existence. I don’t think about suicide because I’m too inadequate even for that. I don’t want to leave other people in a bad situation because of my inability to live. That’s it, I don’t know what to do, and I don’t think there’s much anyone can do to help me. I’d like to write more, but I feel like even here, in a place meant for this, im bothering yall w my stuff",1.0,depression

"The guy who gets bullied and gets depressed, yeah that's me... I was like 13 when some of seniors at my school punched me in the face for not sitting quietly when they ha told so. I tried to be the 'only' brave guy in town and got up trying to fight back, well things turned around. I was punched in the face, pushed to the ground, kicked and then carried away all infront of my school. It was normal for seniors to hit us juniors but this was insane...

And then everyone was like mad at me for trying to be a hero and they said that I should've stayed quite and left after the first punch.

Later on due to me being the hot topic of laughter my parents learned of the whole deal and reported the case to the authorities. My parents were mad at me for not telling the whole thing to them before hand. And then the school authority blamed me for picking up a fight because they thought that I was the troublesome one.

When word got out that my parents had made a big fuss, the whole school literally sided with the seniors because they thought it to be 'normal', to be beaten and humiliated in front of everyone. They shunned me and my friends never talked to me. For the rest of my time in school whenever I tried to do anything, everyone would just point out oh he's the kid who got beaten up and then ran up to his parents. I had elder brothers who I thought would help but all they did was tell me I should've fought back better.

Anyways the seniors learned that I had caused a fuss over this and said that I had tried to fight back. They told everyone to gather up, and said that whoever thought that I'd been a rebel should come out. Nobody came out and then they called a few of my friends. Only a single guy took my side and they beat him up. Then they called me out and slapped me and humiliated me infront of everyone. 

The authority shut the whole case up and everyone shunned me for being the idiot. My parents, my siblings  and my school friends. And everywhere I went I felt like I was being watched and ridiculed from afar. 

I lost my confidence, whenever someone would touch me unexpectedly I would get flustered and angry. Whenever someone would speak loudly, I'd just want to hide and go invisible. I'd lose my calm. 

I don't know if it's a reason to be f*ed up or even depressed and I haven't gotten proper therapy for my situation. All the time people just told me to get over it and make myself stronger because of it. I can't, I just can't. Because even today when I'm 19 I don't know what the fuck it was or if this was a joke, a trauma or something just lively. 

The guy who was the most vocal and physical said sorry to me many times at the end of the year but I don't know, if I forgive him. I don't know if it was wrong or if I should forgive him. I just don't know what it all was. And me not forgiving him makes me feel guilty. I just can't see him once in a month or two and be happy about myself. I don't know if I should feel bad or why I'm even depressed. 

Ps this is the first time I've discussed this shit and your the only people I've reached out to after 5 years. Just pls respond and tell me something.

"Being chronically Ill sucks and life keeps shoving my face in the dirt I got diagnosed with colitis a few years ago and its been making my life hell ever since... When I was first starting to have problems I was (19) about to finish school, and because of being sick I had to literally repeat the last year of classes a few months before finals. After I went into remission I thankfully could finish school with my grades realatively intact. 

Everything seemed to be going fine and I went to university to become a teacher until both my parents died this year in march and now my depression and colitis have been spiraling out of control and feeding off of each other as stress keeps making my colitis worse and my colitis is stressing me out because my life is such a mess because of it. I had to drop out of uni too because my state can't fucking pay for enough profs to hold enough courses and at the rate I was able to attend I would have been in uni until 30 (I'm 24 btw) which I couldn't afford because u know I need to earn money somehow and I wasn't able to manage both university and a job at the same time because of my colitis, so I just recently startet my education to become a driving instructor and I'm already missing out on so many lectures because my body is fucking trash and my colitis decided to flare up again... and If I miss too many classes I won't be allowed to take the final exam which would mean that I wasted another whole year and 15k in cash as thats how much the course costs... 

God forbid I enjoy my life to much as every time I try to make something out of myself I get kicked back down in the dirt... I seriously dont know how to live like this...

"Been feeling a lot like this lately I’m 27 M, and I’m just tired of being alive. I don’t want to exist anymore. I live in my moms basement and I have no savings or funds. I’m working a part time job at a gym, since I can’t find a job working full-time and I need money. Everyone I know around me is doing great in life, my friends are either financially stable, have their own place or have some sort of career that is fulfilling to them. I’ve got nothing going for me and I don’t have any ambitions or would even know how to go about finding happiness in life.

Recently I finally got around to watching smiling friends and the first episode is one that really hits close to home. Spoilers but I’m using a quote from the episode said by Desmond.

“That’s exactly it. Are the best parts of life really just finding momentary distractions to keep yourself busy so you don’t think about the harsh realities of life for a second? I can ride roller coasters, meet new friends, and spend time with my family all day long, it doesn’t change the fact that the sun is just going to explode, and all this was for nothing.”

I’ve been feeling a lot like this lately of “what’s the point of being alive?” At the end of the episode, Desmond ends up finding his purpose in life. However, I don’t think everyone finds their purpose in life. So that being said, what is the point of this? I wish I could kill myself but I have family that cares about me. I know that could be used as a reason to stay alive but is that just my purpose? To be alive for others? I’m not even having a good time in life so how does that even make me feel good or happy? We all die eventually, why shouldn’t I just make it happen sooner rather than wait for it later?",1.0,depression

"I don’t want to live anymore  I was with my ex for 5 years. Married for a year. We were the perfect couple. From Prom to Graduation, to having our first apt, to getting our first cars together, we had the cat and the dogs. I thought I would be with this girl forever. Long story short she left me almost 3 years ago after an argument. We had small disagreements but I feel like she just couldn't communicate properly when she would get mad. She would say things like ""I know someone that can treat me better"" and other things along that line that made it seem like she was talking to someone else. I wanted to treat her like a princess but after saying stuff like that I was almost impossible for me. I always made sure she didn't feel like someone could take her spot and she didn't do the same for me. I felt replaceable. I'm just so confused and hurt because all this time has passed and she still calls and texts me and we go to dinner and have sex but she doesn't want to be with me. whenever I push for us to get back together she pushes me away and tells me how horrible I was in our relationship and how much damage I caused her. I really feel like I was good to her so saying stuff like that fucks with my head. I can't leave her alone because I love her so much but I feel like she's just using me now and that hurts as well. It's been 3 years since we spilt and I still cry myself to sleep most nights and throughout the day holding back my tears.  Why does she keep communicating with me ?

I also have bad anxiety and cannot meet or talk to anybody even my closest friends without feeling super on edge and uncomfortable. I have super intense body dysmorphia focused on my face even though everyone tells me i’m really attractive and above average it means nothing to me which I think stems from not being as attractive as a child/teen and being made to feel that way. I go into what feel like uncontrollable episodes where my perception of how I look is literally distorted even when I look in the mirror and it makes me look so strange in my head. It’s not even necessarily that I think i’m ugly, I just feel like I look like a f*cking alien. I have loads of things I want to do like be a musician and get a part-time job at a bar and work in the film industry and go to more live music shows and just meet loads of interesting people and talk to them and while doing all this hopefully also growing as a person and experiencing new things. I just want to live an interesting life true to myself. I honestly feel like it is impossible to just do that. I have everything physically I could need to do and achieve what I want (apart from lots of money) but my mind is tearing me to pieces. My adhd makes things feel impossible and i’m so sick of missing out on opportunities and living a normal life for no good reason. I can’t do anything because of my mind. It feels like if I just went f*ck it and stopped caring I could do so well but I just can’t let go for all the things from my past holding me down. I can’t hold the weight much longer and it just feels like there are two worlds and I am stuck between them. One world where I am successful and carefree and at peace and another world where I have killed myself and I’m not fully living in either one, I’m teetering in the middle and not committing to anything but instead living in a realm of non-existence and dullness. I have all the knowledge I could ever need to get better, I know exactly what I need to do but I can’t do it for the life of me.

"I don’t want to grow up Idk what is wrong with me, last yr when I turned 19 I felt fine- happy even. I remember when I turned 18 I had a huge panic attack but I got over it pretty quickly since I was still a teenager. It’s been an entire week and a half since I turned 20 and I feel physically ill. All of a sudden, I clearly remember core memories dating back to when I was 3/4 yrs old. I started looking through all of my old photos from 4th-12th grade and cannot believe I am already a junior in college. I feel like the same 16 yr old I was during COVID- I dress the same & look almost the same (except I lost 40 lbs). I look at other people around my age and they look a lot older. One of my high school friends even got married & I remember thinking “omg that’s child marriage”, but she’s an adult. I keep counting down the yrs- for example I loved my middle school yrs and I was around 13 when it ended which was 7 yrs ago- I will be 27 in 7 yrs. I am literally going insane. I want to go back to being a child all of a sudden- back when I didn’t have to worry about building a stable career or having societal pressures to have my shit together. I even engage in childish behavior sometimes- I catch myself talking in a baby voice to my family and sometimes I even sit in the backseat of my mom’s car not realizing how strange that is. Oddly enough ppl who r not my family members have always thought of me as mature for my age. I even vividly remember my senior yr of high school, which was an entire 3 yrs ago. Back then I felt old but I took for granted how young 17/18 really is. I know how stupid this sounds as I am fully aware that 20 is still a young adult but I recently hung out with my younger cousins (14 & 9) and immediately started balling my eyes out when I came back home. I still feel like that girl entering freshman yr of high school & having my first panic attack in my bathroom from feeling lost. Sorry for rambling, I just don’t rlly have anyone who shares the same emotions as I do since my friends don’t rlly seem to be affected. I cannot stop crying in outbursts & feeling feverish & I know how stupid this all will seem when I get older. I just wish I had more years of childhood since it felt so short & there seems to be decades of having to be an adult.

"I can't take it anymore New account, so IDEK if this'll get published. Also, the nature of my post might violate the rules, but I'm desperate, so I'm taking the chance. I just need some advice. Without getting too much into it, my life's always been hell, but it got worse in the past 9 months. If I were to stay alive, I'd certainly suffer even more. I'm tired of everything, I've tried therapy, meds, anything you can think of, and nothing's worked. I'm just one of those lost causes. Due to my 5+ mental disorders and the inevitable physical consequences that follow (such as brain damage which prevents me from finishing uni or getting a job), I have no way out and am a complete failure and a nuisance to everyone around. I have no degree, job, friends, partner, no way of leading a worthy life, and no time or possibility to make any changes. The only people in my life who care about me are my Mom and Aunt, and both of them are old. My every waking moment is filled with misery and agony. In two weeks, I'll finally have the house to myself, so I've decided to attempt. I have a stash of sleeping pills (bromazepam, promazine and zolpidem), all in varying quantities. I also have a large amount of beta blockers which I have been hoarding for 2 years. I know that, statistically, my chances of succeeding are abysmally low, but I have exhausted all other options and just want to be rid of this body and this life. My question are as follow: 

1. Which amount of all of these pills combined would do the job? Keep in mind that my body has developed a resistance to sleeping pills, but I am still able to take a lot of pills without getting sick. Beta blockers, I assume, would slow down my heartbeat, and the sleeping pills in a large quantity would knock me out. 

2. Would it be too painful? What would it look/feel like?

3. Should I mix it with wine or water or will that only make me throw it all up? 

4. I'm gonna regret asking this, cause the answer has the potential to freak me out, but regardless... What are my chances of succeeding rather than ending up like a vegetable or with severe consequences? I can probably get away with having around 12 hours to myself without having to be in contact with my family members. 

If this doesn't get taken down, I'd appreciate any advice (except for the standard ""it'll get better, just try harder"" ones, cause I have, I already tried to recover so many times, but it is simply impossible for me and this is the only way out). Thank you. ",-1.0,depression

"Understanding a NEET Hello, I’m a 20 year old guy and this is my vent post. My situation is not a rare one and I hope that you will read it; we have a duty to understand our neighbors better. 



To start off with I am not suicidal but I am not happy either. Usually I feel nothing, just a cold detachment, but occasionally I feel an emotion strongly. Typically this emotion is anger or a profound sense of defeatedness. I know exactly why I feel this way but take no action to change anything. This is because I feel it's not possible, that no matter what I do I am doomed to stay where I am. Everything I do in my life is in response to an outside force, I shave only because I had work that day, I leave my house only because I am out of food. I have no friends because of this, and that sense of loneliness is crushing. I have no career because of this, and that lack of challenge leaves me bored. I do not engage with the world at all, and it's rotting my soul. Everyday I feel myself regress further into some kind of plant-like lifeform. I want desperately to experience what the world has to offer me but it feels impossible. If you met me in person you would think “Wow! That guy does nothing? What a loser.” In this next bit I will try to explain how I got here, and please have some empathy for one of us NEETs next time you meet one.



My life has been incredibly traumatizing.  I was a victim of several violent sexual assaults as a child and while that was horrible I would have been in a very similar situation regardless. The main reason I am where I am is because of my parents and inherited trauma. My parents are very nice, when people meet them they make sure to tell me how lucky I am. I smile and say “Yes, I love my dad. He is so kind.” I can’t say the truth, that both of my parents were the victims of abuse themselves and never found a way to heal from those wounds, and instead passed them onto me. My mom is a brilliant woman but lacks the emotional ability to be a parent. I could not go to her as a child because any time I would express what I need, she would take it as an attack and tell me that I didn’t actually need that thing or that I already had it. This is not entirely her fault, she had to raise herself and never saw what a parent was. My dad is the opposite. He was receptive to my needs but lacked the knowledge on how to meet them. His father died when he was a teenager and both of his parents were completely emotionally absent. My dad has a good job now but he, like my mom, never managed to overcome his traumas. 



I had to figure the world out completely on my own while being sexually abused, this of course was not possible to do as a child. I had (and have) been tasked with figuring out how to heal from the trauma passed on to me from both of my parents as well as my own. This burden left me incredibly unhealthy and alienated from my peers and the world. I am still trying my best to fight these battles but the progress is slow. The only way to bear the weight of my situation is to be completely deactivated most of the time, and only feel and think very occasionally. In these moments of lucidity I have made progress and I do have hope for myself but it's going to take awhile. 



There is much more I could say but I don’t want this post to be unreadably long and some of it I just don’t know how to put into words. But, I want you to understand that when you see someone who you think is a loser, or someone that you don’t understand, there is a reason they are the way that they are, and that they need your love. We are all on this planet at the same time together, we are all connected in that way and it's our duty to love and support others in the ways that we can. Love all of you.

"how to avoid the rot? hi all.

I’ve been feeling a little better these past few weeks. I started my new job, and I’m scared of messing up but it’s going ok so far.

My biggest struggle right now is that I can’t seem to force myself out of rotting. If that makes any sense.

I either just lay in bed for hours doing nothing but being miserable, or scroll on my phone for hours, and at best play a video game or read a comic.

It feels like I’m decomposing from the inside out. I don’t know what to do about it. I go on walks. I do my chores. I pet and feed my cats. It doesn’t seem to help.

"I(24f) find it very eery to sleep in my bedroom where I was sexually abused as a child (9 yrs old) As the title suggests, it feels very strange and eery sleepy in my room on the second floor (if at all I manage to sleep, usually I cant sleep there because I get this strange feeling of uneasiness). Sometimes i hear footsteps up the stairs or random thuds on the door that leads to the terrace right outside my room. (There was an instance of the abuser picking me up and running up the stairs to my bedroom, not sure if its connected).

I feel scared and nervous while Im in this room and somehow feels very mysterious and sinister. 

I used to wake up with panic at night 1 year post that abuse, and even though the panic eventually went away, the sleeplessness never did. Now I can’t sleep in the darkness alone and its come to this point where I cant sleep alone until I pass out from fatigue (even with the lights on)

"I'd better be off with amnesia This pain is killing me. There are so many things going on around me, and my love life is the most painful one I need to tackle because I don’t know exactly what to do. I found this guy very charming—someone I look up to because of the way he handles things. I find him smart, and to me, that’s attractive. We got along at first, but when his ex reached out, everything between us became blurry. I felt disrespected when he was with his ex while I was with my friend, who is also his friend. The woman he’s with asked him to call us, and he called my friend but ignored me. I know it was a way for her to feel like she won him, and I can’t understand why he did that. He knows that I like him and probably knew that it would hurt me, but he still did it. He could have respected me by declining her request.

After my friend left on a motorcycle, I walked out and left the place immediately. That woman, her sister, and her friends confronted me, but I never heard anything from him about standing up for me. One of her friends even sent me an unkind message and commented negatively on one of my social media accounts. I kept my mouth shut and didn’t respond to any of them. Despite all this, because of my love for this guy, I let all the pain he caused me slip away and continued to be kind.

This guy gives me mixed signals. I don’t know if he wants me or not, and every time I ask, he doesn’t give me a concrete answer. What hurts even more is that I still love him, even after he has ignored me and disrespected me in front of her and all our friends.

"Keep thinking of a past overdose. I’m 20 right now, and when I was 16, I overdosed. it was nearly fatal. I remember taking 200 triple c’s otherwise known as an over the counter drug that continues to haunt my mind. I was in mine and my brothers bedroom, my bed was halfway in the closet so I sat where my pillow was to not be seen taking them. I struggled getting the last handful down, but as soon as I got it down, I threw up real bad. After throwing up, I don’t remember anything, or so I want to tell myself.

I continuously have these visions or memories in my mind that play several times. their of me. me floating above my body, looking down at it. it feels like I can vividly see what my body looked like. this first started happening around 2 years ago, when I asked my mom what I looked like when I overdosed, she described it exactly how I was picturing it. it’s eerie. ive kept seeing that in my mind ever since, but there are times where my mind is free. recently this year, ive been seeing it differently. it starts with the usual me staring at my body above myself, but then I looked at my brother, he was confused when he heard my bed moving, he got up to see me seizing and started to panic. he called 911, freaking out. then a skip of sorts comes to my mom and my brother walking back in the room, my mom is crying, both of them panicking. then that’s it, it all goes black and then I hear a deep voice say “you are going to die.”

I first had this latest event play like it was a dream, I remember waking up shaking, I felt weird.

nowadays my life is pretty shitty, I’m homeless right now and so is my mom. ive actually been able to get out of homelessness only for me to make a shitty mistake. whenever I think if it now and how I was in the past, it makes me sad. i used to be a terrible person, and whenever I think of how bad of a person I was, my mind goes back to the overdose, making me want to attempt again. ive cried over this, I honestly don’t know how to rid myself of it. been thinking I’ll just end it all for real one day, off those same pills that fucked up my mental process so bad. then I think, what if my dumbass survives again somehow. I would probably be stuck in psychosis again, but probably permanently and I know how bad it was last time.

I don’t want to go through this anymore. I’m still a bad person and every action I perform just makes my head feel worse, ive lost people. friends. even family from my behavior. I constantly reflect on it and tell myself I’m doing better and actively feel like I’m doing better and on my way to become this good person I want to be so bad, only to try and reconcile with someone I knew in the past and fuck it up once again. that turned into a cycle that I don’t want to be in. I never wanted to be in that cycle. I was never meant to make it past that overdose. whatever told me I was going to die sounded serious. but I survived. after that I met some video game friends atter I was out of psychosis and everything was cool. until that shitty side of me came back. I constantly talk to god, but my spiraling emotions, personality’s, I feel like he’s getting tired of it, in fact, I feel like I’m talking to nothing at all. all I ask is for help. but theres nothing is there?

"Why should I stay here? Hello!! I'm not expecting anyone to read this or respond, I am just journaling my feelings, and maybe if you feel/have felt similar, we can talk about it. I'd like to start this off by saying I'm not actively suicidal, but I'd be lying if I said I haven't ideated quite a bit. So, I've struggled pretty severely with my mental health since I was about 5 for various reasons, but the depression really set in when I was around 15. I'm 20 now, and it hasn't really let up since then. I've learned that for whatever cosmic reason, whenever things are going well for a period of time, like a month or two, it's usually followed by a pain worse than anything I'd ever experienced prior. Whenever I feel like I'm at the bottom, I know I'm only at the ocean floor above the Mariana. I know this isn't a universal law or something, it's just a pattern in my life that I've noticed and that it's served me well to anticipate. Enough yapping to say I'm one sad fucker of mothers, but I know it could be much worse. I know that the universal powers that be, God or science, don't have anything personal against me, but it really does feel like someone up there is shotgunning a beer in front of the control panel with their 40,000 eyed buddies and saying ""but you know what would be even funnier??"" I gotta admit, it's pretty fucking funny.

But the big question that's been on my mind is, why should I stay here?? When I first seriously considered suicide, there were a few key reasons that I didn't go through with it. In summary, I told myself that all things must pass, it will get better and someday I'll be able to make a home for myself with someone where we can be safe and rewrite our painful histories together. I guess that I believed that for all of my suffering that I was owed something by God for my suffering and love I've given, but lately I've come to the realization that as much as I don't deserve to suffer, I don't deserve happiness either. No one owes me anything, no one's in debt to me, let alone God. ""Put out love into the world and it will come back to you,"" bull-fucking-shit. I put my love out into the world and got abused, broken, and taken advantage of to a point that I don't even know what fully trusting someone means anymore. My point is, the reasons that I chose to stay back then are not solid reasons, and I'm feeling the cracks. Hope, as I've come to understand it, is a dangerous substance that mostly leads to painful anticipation in the short term, and horrible disappointment in the long term if it's something worth hoping for. I just never gave my reasons much thought after that, even though if I thought about it I knew they were shaky, I just had to convince myself I had strong reasons for being here because I couldn't think of anything better.

Point is, saying that things will get better is an innacurate statement, because no one's guaranteeing that it is, and from what I've observed, it only seems like it's going to get harder. It might get better for some people, sure, but it might get worse right after that, or just stay the same. I'm a Christian, despite my strongly pessimistic tone, and I want to believe that God has a plan for me, but what if God's plan for me is to die of cancer when I'm 25?? Or maybe I get t-boned coming home from work and end up as a statistic in the book of life. Over the course of my life, I've struggled with developing feelings of limerence for people who made me feel even remotely safe. I mean it makes sense, but trying to deal with and heal from that and develop healthier thinking habits, it's made me realize that my reasons for being here can't be based in other people either. People are unreliable, among whom I am chief, we come and go and have our own stories going on, and if I somehow lost my friends or hypothetical significant other, then I wouldn't have a reason for living anymore. It can't be because of a hope for the future, because I'd rather be pleasantly surprised than be hurt by faith 10x worse than I already was.

On the topic of being alone, sometimes I feel like the only one left. All of the friends I've made over the course of my teenage years I wouldn't trade for the world, I am honored to know such sweet and amazing people. Unfortunately, everyone in my main circle found their people, who they could fully trust and be completely physically/emotionally vulnerable with, except me. And I know it isn't a facade either, they truly found love and I truly am happy for them, I just wish that could be me too, you know?? I just wish I got a happy ending too. Even for my friends who were in abusive relationships, there was always someone waiting for them with open arms not long after they escaped their toxic relationships, just not for me. Sometimes I wonder why I had to end up with the people who seemed so kind and genuine at first but just wanted to take what I had without giving anything back to me, but asking why doesn't help with anything, especially when it's a question without an answer. 

I haven't really talked with anyone about this, but I'm not anyone's number 1, and it bothers me. It's selfish, and close friendship is irreplacable, but they all have their people who they can return to at the end of the day. They all have their person whose arms they can fall in when they're crying, and who they can make breakfast for the next morning. No one misses me or worries about me in the way they worry for their partners, and that's okay. Friendship is different than romance and they fulfill different needs, which is why when someone says that platonic love is enough to fulfill the needs of romantic love, it's just not true. If it was, people wouldn't feel neglected when their partner doesn't touch them. It's always the people who are happy in relationships telling me that too, which I would be lying if I said it didn't piss me off just an eense. Whenever I hang out with my friends who are in couples, I know they love me and don't mean to, but they make me feel so alone. I see them holding eachother, playing around, consoling one another, or just taking care of eachother in a way that I can't know. I can vent to them, but they're not gonna hold me. I can hug them, but they're not gonna kiss my head. I can only imagine how serene and peaceful it must feel to be able to be fully vulnerable with someone in that way, because I've been so close to it so many times. Love isn't the end-all-be-all, but it's pretty damn important. I wish I could be happy being single, but I'm just not. 

The problem is, I don't even know how I would go about finding anyone anymore. I can't just go out and flirt with people, because I need to know someone, at least for a little bit, so I can relatively understand what I'm getting into before jumping into a relationship, but I can't afford that time or luxury anymore. I wish I could still get to know someone and lay down a foundation of friendship first to build our romance on like everyone else I know, but the only places I really can meet anyone are places I have to spend money, like record stores, bars, concerts, coffee shops, what have you. They're not there to meet people 99% of the time and are usually already with someone, and no one whose ever approached me first in the past by themselves has had good intentions. Plus, I'm also not just going to flirt with a barista while she's in the middle of her shift, because there's people behind me and 3 other guys have already probably flirted with her today and made her uncomfortable and had to deal with 4 bitchy moms in the last 5 minutes. But even if I did successfully get someone's number at a concert or something, I don't know ANYTHING about them. I was always told ""just ask her out, the worst she can say is no"" which is NOT true. The worst they can say is ""yes"" which is followed by me getting hurt even worse than I was before, or I realize they're not the right fit for me and I have to figure out how to tell them without hurting them or accidentally starting a huge fight that leaves me shaking, hurt, and triggered.

If I meet someone pretty who acts interested in me, no matter how kind they seem, I have no idea of knowing who they are when they're angry, or when they're sad, or if I'm even talking to the real them. But then again, I was friends with my ex for over a year before we dated, and we became really close friends during that time and I would have NEVER in a million years ever thought she would treat me how she did, I just didn't know because she liked me the whole time and had a very strong facade. As I'm entering adult life, finding people to even be friends with is so much harder than before. I know I just need to put myself out there and try and fail, and not everyone is out to get me, but love isn't gonna fulfill me either, I'll still have the same gremlins in my brain chewing on my wires and shitting on the carpet. Even if I do find love, they can't be my reason for living, because that isn't fair to anyone involved. It makes sense, I was love and touch starved in my childhood so I'd feel the same as an adult, but I'm sure it would be something else after that. The big ""if only."" Plus, I've spent my whole life living for other people. My reasons for living need to be in and of myself. I can't live for a future I may never see.

On a different topic, philosophy is one of the things I'm passionate about, and I've tried exploring this question through the lens of philosophy, and for a while I agreed with Camus' teaching about suicide, to live as your own revolt against the absurd, I've come to a bit of a different view now. I disagree strongly with the notion that suicide means someone is weak, but being strong doesn't mean that they can't get tired. It's not a solution, because who or what is the revolt even against? What's the point of fighting against nothing, other than wearing yourself out? Revolt only does good when it brings about positive change. Otherwise, why bother?? What's the point of having a protest if nothing's gonna change? Fighting it is even more absurd than life itself. I've fought the absurdity of life for as long as I've breathed and only come out bruised and tired. If I want to live, I don't want to live fighting life. Sometimes it just feels like nothing more than a cosmic shout into the great pillow. But in the end, I like drama too much to ever not want to know what happens next. There's so many wonderful people on this earth who I am so privileged to know/have known. Life and nature are beautiful, and there is more to this life than we understand. There's so many questions I have and things that I want to learn about, I could never hope to learn even a speck of it in a million lifetimes. Music and artistic expression are the closest things that I've found to any sort of meaning.

So in summary, I don't have solid reasons for being here, which worries me because I know things can and most likely will get much worse before it gets better, if it even does. And if it's already bad now, how much worse will it be then? I can't place my reasons in the future, because hope is dangerous and the future is uncertain, and also the future of America isn't looking great at the moment, especially if you're trying to not be homeless. Even if I someday got my ranch, grandkids, true love and a glass of whiskey on the rocks, would the payoff be worth all of the agony it takes to get there? Will I be disappointed? Will anything of my spirit even be left to enjoy it?? How many heads would I have to step on to get there? I can't place my reasons in people, because we change, we come, and we go. If everyone goes, what else will I have? My reasons can't be revolt, because I don't want to live the rest of my life fighting. Right here, right now, in this moment, why shouldn't I just skip all of the bullshit and go to Heaven or the warm black embrace of death?? If God hasn't already damned me to hell already, that is. I'm sure I could have worded a lot of this much better, there's a lot of very important things I left out, but I've already got a bible here, so I'm leaving it off here for now.",1.0,depression

We're looking to grow the moderation team here at r/Anxiety. Moderators are a key part of what makes any Reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What does a moderator do?

Moderators here at r/Anxiety  work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of anxiety and the ways that anxiety and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply? 

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about the topic of anxiety and the r/Anxiety community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you, there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open-ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know, we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the Reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com/)

# What are the expectations for users who join the r/Anxiety moderation team?

We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our moderation team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of Reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Anything I should know before I apply?

Yes, r/Anxiety is a support community for anxiety and other related illnesses and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our Discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a Discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/Anxiety ?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) and your application. If we find your answers satisfactory, we will send a form for you to fill out.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our Discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/Anxiety moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about three weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!",1.0,anxiety

"Angry I just found out about propranolol I just started propranolol today, 10mg, and it feels like MAGIC, after years of being on SSRIs/meditation/relaxation/CBT/ACT/etc. My heart rate moderated, my intense anxiety body sensations like chills, tremors, went away. I estimate now that 90% of my severe work anxiety was caused by fear to adrenaline-triggered body sensations, and only 10% was triggered by my thoughts. 

I feel I finally have a fighting chance. CBT works better. Breathing works better. SSRIs keep doing their thing. I almost took benzos out of desperation….maybe I don’t need them.

It is almost impossible to beat adrenaline when it’s working incorrectly and overwhelmingly. Propranolol is massively helping. It cuts the mind > body > mind vicious cycle, and allows me to do the mental work. 

It is insulting and enraging that this is not prescribed more to eligible patients. A lot of suffering can be avoided. “Only” reducing the physical symptoms can be a massive win. I cannot understand how doctors don’t get that breaking the feedback loop between mind and body CAN allow the patient to better tackle the root cause of their anxiety.

If you’re in the fence, my advice is take the propranolol. Try it on a low dose. Consult your doctor if needed. It’s safe, and  might also give you a fighting chance against the monster of chronic anxiety.

Edit: thank your /r/Anxiety community because I found out about propranolol because of you.",1.0,anxiety

I want to try the 10 mg but I’m already super tired as is and my heart rate is already lower. Would going up to 10 mg make me lightheaded/dizzy? Would it slow my heart rate significantly more?

"i had the worst panic attack of my life last night and almost had to call an ambulance this post contains mention of drug use and description of a panic attack

my fiance and i were getting ready for bed last night. we had smoked a joint as we do sometimes and put the puppies in the crate and went downstairs. normally, smoking weed puts be right to sleep. 

when walking downstairs i noticed i got a little light headed and then started to just feel super cold. my skin wasn’t cold, but i felt like i was in an ice bath. my heart started to race and i checked my heart rate and it was 135bpm. my fiance is in nursing school so i looked over at her and told her it was getting hard to breathe. she came over and tried to walk me through some of my regular exercises that help calm me down but after that, my heart rate was up to 160bpm. 

we went back upstairs and i put my shoes on and went to go sit in the grass outside for a minute. she tries to call an ambulance but because we live somewhere with no service it doesn’t go through. she runs back inside to grab her phone and i look down at my watch and my heart rate is 176bpm. shortly after i checked i felt sick to my stomach and threw up on the grass beside me.
 
it felt like the whole world was caving in on me. i layed down completely in the grass and just let the earth consume me. she came out and checked my heart rate and it went down to 160bpm. she asked if i still wanted her to call an ambulance and i (having recognized it was a panic attack at this point) told her to just wait a couple minutes and see if it gets better. eventually it went down to 100bpm (which is still high but significantly better) and we went back inside.

I want to get my GED but I can't afford to pay for it, as my family doesn't have a car right now and I can't get a job. Because all of the ones close to me that I could walk to, arent hiring or won't respond to applications. 
I know college wouldn't be for me, but I want to go to trade school. Be a welder, which is something ive wanted to do since I was 13. But I obviously need my GED to apply for that because that is one of the only requirements. 

I just feel stuck. Like I'm too young to do anything to fix my situation, but too old to be upset about it. ",1.0,anxiety

"standing up for myself makes me terribly anxious  for the longest time now, i've struggled with anxiety, i think ever since i was a little kid. idk why but standing up for myself makes me feel so scared, i have explosive anger which makes me do and say impulsive things when im angry, such as being rude and mean. whenever this happens, moments after i get plagued with this intense deep feeling that im going to be hurt, that the person i offended is gonna kill me or kill my family or things like that. i can't talk back to people because im so fucking scared, and when i do it always lingers on my mind and i get a feeling of impending doom. i think it's gotten past the point of anxiety and reaching paranoia, it's so debilitating and draining to live like this and i really dont know what to do, how to cope, or anything. is this common or am i js fucking crazy???",-1.0,anxiety

"my anxiety isn’t mental, it’s physical, and i don’t know what to do.  when i say i have anxiety, people assume it’s social or that i have uncontrollable thoughts. no. when i’m anxious i feel dissociated, extremely nauseous, i can’t breathe, etc. it feels like people only understand anxiety as one thing — that mental manifestation of racing thoughts and fear, and it feels like i’m never going to find the thing that actually aids my anxiety because it feels like medications and therapies aren’t “made” for me.

"Anybody else just fantasize about running away and starting a whole new life? My life should be perfect.

I’m currently a sophomore at a big 10 University. I live in a house with a bunch of my friends, my boyfriend and family live about an hour and a half away. I have a job, I like my major generally, my friends are good.

I am CONSTANTLY fantasizing about grabbing my family and my boyfriend and running away to some distant land and never seeing anyone else again. I fantasize about dropping out of school, quitting my job, leaving this city and moving somewhere remote where I never have to talk to anyone else other than my boyfriend and my family. Sometimes this urge is so strong I just burst into tears.

This should be the happiest time of my life, I have the ideal situation on the outside. I have a strong support system, I do well in school, my finances are the best they’ve ever been. So WHY can’t I shake this feeling of “GO”

I was just wondering if anyone has gone through something similar? My anxiety makes me think everything is “a sign” and I can’t tell if I’m actually unhappy here or if it’s just my anxiety talking. I feel like I should be happier than I am, but I’m never satisfied. ",1.0,anxiety
"What to do with the weekday morning anxiety? Weekday mornings have been bad for me well over a decade and it feels like it's getting worse year by year. It gets quite overwhelming after weekends and holidays.

"Any tips for morning cortisol / adrenaline burst? The last few months have been very stressful due to family health issues.

Normally after any disruptive, stressful time, I'll have a few days of ""morning sickness"" where I wake up nauseous, tense, trembling, etc. And the physical symptoms drive my brain into anxious thought patterns.

But I've now been in this heightened state for weeks. Every morning is very unpleasant and debilitating, and I don't begin to normalize until the late afternoon. By late night, I'm feeling almost myself again.

I recently was prescribed propranolol, and it helps a little with the trembling, but not the stomach clenching. Honestly propranolol is very hit or miss for me. Sometimes 10mg feels very potent, and sometimes 20mg seems to have no effect.

Xanax is a bit stronger in dealing with the morning burst, but obviously I don't want to take that every day.

I'm using Calm, I'm box breathing, and I've started taking magnesium and Omega-3 supplements. 

But I'd love to hear if anyone else has a similar situation and any pro tips.

(Fun fact: I tried getting up an hour earlier than normal and did not feel the cortisol burst... until the hour had passed. Then it hit me, at the normal time, even though I'd already been awake and active for a while. It is on a clockwork schedule. Though at least I was able to sneak in a breakfast before the nausea hit).",1.0,anxiety

Whole body is numb, like actually can’t feel my body most of the time when I touch it. I haven’t even been able to drive for months because when I drive it’s like I’m in a simulation, I feel so outside of myself.

Academic anxiety  I don’t know who I am writing this for. I don’t even know what I am asking advice for. I feel so alone. I have academic anxiety and it’s not like most people think. It’s not the normal type of stress that keeps you motivated. It’s not the type of adrenaline that comes on when you get a test grade back. It’s sitting in class fighting back tears because you are terrified you won’t have enough time to study. It’s never failing a test in your life but having a pit in your stomach that you are going to fail out of a class. I can’t look at another person without thinking “I wonder how much they have to study for a test” or “How can they still be having fun when I am at home studying”. All of this may seem silly to most people but it’s slowly killing me. I am nothing without my good grades in school. My brain is going 100 miles a minute when I think about the school semester. I can’t stop studying. I study from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep. If I am not studying I feel like I am doing something wrong and that I should be studying. But when I am studying I feel this indescribable fear of not absorbing the material and failing. I am losing weight because I can’t eat from my anxiety. I can’t sleep because all I am thinking about is failing. I can’t relax. I am in this sense of constant fight or flight and it’s wearing me down. I am internally screaming. I don’t know how much longer I can go on feeling this way. I am in my last year of college now. I am almost done but it feels so far away. ,1.0,anxiety
"No matter what you are going through right now, it doesn't mean it will be like this forever. I was at a place in my life about two years ago, where I felt trapped in anxiety. It cost me my job and nearly destroyed my life.

Fear literally held me in bed. I didn't want to be around anyone or anything. My bed was my only safe place. My life was miserable. 

If it had to be like this forever, I would rather die. That's how I felt at the time. How could it possibly get better? How could I ever feel normal or happy again?

Everything looked dark and bleak and I thought my situation was worse than anyone else. Most people got better, but they didn't have it as bad as me. I would never get better. This was the lie that held a grip on my life. I was drowning in crippling fear.

But two years later, I am living a quite normal life. I still have days of manageable anxiety, but nothing anywhere near it used to be. 

I read the Bible, and when I felt more alone in my room than ever in my life, I found the presence of Jesus there with me. Reading the Bible and His promises of peace helped me to hold on.

Medication also played a large role, and I urge anyone to seek medical support. This is a physical problem that needs physical help. I believe spirtual promises gave me the hope and strength to get up and seek that help and that God blessed that medicine to treat my problem.

"Celexa/Citalopram helped me so much and I want to share my experience.  Hi everyone. Real quick, everyone is different and react differently to meds, however, I would like to share my positive experience taking celexa for those who may be too scared to take it! 

I was terrified to take it because of the side effects and researching obsessively for two months. I was also worried IF I was bipolar (I was diagnosed with it a long time ago, and never follow up, so I was worried the SSRI would send me into a manic episode). Needless to say, I was so scared. 

I am SO SENSITIVE to anything like vitamins, alcohol, meds...etc. I decided to get a pill cutter and break my 10 MG celexa into quarters. Yes, quarters. My doctor also said this was okay to do if half a pill was too strong. 

I took the pill and the following happened within the first two weeks. 

1. Nightmares! Everynight when I first took it, I would have intense realistic nightmares! 

2. Insomnia. I had a really hard to getting to sleep. 

3. Fatigue. I would sleep for a long time! I couldn't even wake up at times. It was so hard to stay awake. I almost quit because of this side effect. 

5. Anxiety spiked a little but, not too much, but enough to where I noticed. 

6. I felt numb and I was worried this would last a while, but it didn't.

7. Sexual side effect is real, I don't feel the urge to have any sex. Now, in my case, this is wonderful because I had an unhealthy addiction to it due to trauma, so this helped me be balanced! Find what works for you. I also cannot seem to climax, and when I do, it takes a longer time. 

These side effects did not last long at all, only a few days or so. 

I can now take it at night and fall asleep as needed and wake up feeling normal! 

Here are subtle signs it was working: 

It didn't change my personality. I felt like ""me"". However, here's what OTHER people said. 

""You seem calmer and happier!"" 

""You look focused. You were so scattered and stressed before"" 

""I feel like I don't have to walk on egg shells with you, I'm happy for you"" Heard this from my mom who witnessed my anxiety attacks daily. 

I also felt like I could socialize easier and better! I could pay attention to classes at my college, I could finally do multiple jobs without extreme negative thoughts, (I've been low on money and lost my job recently), my self esteem raised! I still feel nervous, but it's easier to deal with. I wasn't triggered by things that would normally ruin my day. I have energy! I used to get so overstimulated and burned out with everything and anything...now? I live how I would imagine a normal person lives. 

So, if you're scared, please don't be. If you need to break your pill and ease yourself into, do it. If this med doesn't work, find another one.

Any questions, feel free to ask.

"I feel like life is too hard I don't even know where to start.  I live in a new state away from family and friends and have anxiety and depression.  I suck at my job and I am hopelessly single.  My family is toxic and uncaring.  When I go to my friends, they either change the subject or make a joke, so I feel like I cannot talk to them.  I decided to focus on getting better at my job and that has not worked out so well.  Essentially what happens is I plan on working extra on the weekends, but Friday, I am soooooooo TIRED. So I let my self have that evening off.  Then I say Sat and Sun I will work my butt off.  What ends up happening is I procrastinate both days and barely get anything done.  I know why, it's b/c when I start the work I am confronted with feelings of inadequacy, for example, it starts taking too long, I feel stupid and then stop working, go watch YT to ease the pain.  I fool myself into thinking it would only be a short break.

But it ends up lasting hours.    I am also resentful of the fact that I need to put in so many extra hours.  My weekends should be my own.  I should be using my weekend to meet people so I can finally get married.  

EVERYTHING scares and worries me.  I create terrible scenarios in my head when something small goes wrong and I am fixated on it for HOURS and I can't break the chain.  I try to let people in, but they usually respond with don't worry about it.  I guess I am also embarrassed about to share that I am struggling so much.  My place is a mess, I often don't have the energy to clean up after myself and take out my trash, I usually take it out on the 4th or 5th day.

I dread going to work, bc I am bad at it.  I will wakeup early, but then stay in bed until the very last min and am late to work!  

I also get a lot of the physical symptoms that come with anxiety: trouble eating, trouble sleeping, knots in my stomach, nausea, tense muscles in my neck, the runs, heart palpitations, clenching my teeth, night sweats, and headaches. 

Living with anxiety is so bad, I often wish I was NEVER born.  Why do I have to be here?  I didn't ask to be here.  I would never kill myself, bc I believe in God and am a Christian, but it is so unfair that I have to live life when I don't want to.

Therapy is too expensive.  I tell myself to work on it daily, use therapy workbooks, I believe those can work, but I am too overwhelmed by life to do it.  I am often angry with myself for procrastinating.  I am procrastinating right now.

"i’m scared of food? tw: eating disorder maybe like 1.5 years ago, everytime i would lay down and try to sleep.. i’d wake up feeling like i was going to vomit. and I have a very intense fear of vomiting… so this was like debilitating for me. It was every single night. I went to the doctor and they prescribed me prilosec for acid reflux. Okay that helped my original problem.. but then my stomach started to hurt and get upset all the time during the day. it was to the point that i was living off bread and crackers. I go back to the doctor and they did labs, gastric emptying study, tested for celiac and checked all my labs. I had not one, but 2 endoscopies from different doctors and they couldn’t find anything. They basically told me it’s just anxiety. 

Over the course of all this, i lost 70 pounds. I’ve learned to find “safe” foods.. but i still have flare ups when a safe food is apparently not safe.. and my stomach is messed up for a week and i’m back to eating bread and crackers. 

I’m struggling so hard to figure out it’s an actual issue… or if it’s just because i’m obsessionally thinking about how my body is going to react to food. I used to be able to eat literally whatever I wanted. spicy, greasy, fatty… and now i basically eat like 20% of what i used to eat. I started going to therapy and was going to get on meds but them when i started taking them i would get terrible stomach cramps so i just stopped. 

this is honestly ruining my life. Because you have to eat to survive and it’s a constant struggle to figure out what I should eat. I don’t like eating out.. because i don’t like how the food is prepared.. when i’m at home i can make sure it’s not good with tons of butter, etc. it’s so awkward because i don’t  want to tell me, “no i don’t want to go out to eat” but if i do go with them.. im being a weirdo and just eating bread because nothing is “safe” ",1.0,anxiety
"(21F) I have been diagnosed with early onset takosubo broken heart syndrome  So this year was bad these past couple of years been really hard. I have been fully recovered from anorexia for 3 years after having it for almost a decade I nearly  died within that time but now I am still plagued with health issues. I was in a center for most of my teenage years or sick so I never really developed my social skills, had friends, or a boyfriend. I am very stunted in that area. I do everything alone , every activity I engage in my life I do alone, I live with my family still but we don’t eat meals together so even something as simple as having dinner , I do it alone. I have thought about suicide every day for about four years now. 
I ran into a guy (27M) in may this summer , he called my work and left his number , I was really excited. I never even held a guys hand before this or been kissed, he lead me on for 5 months straight, took my virginity. I developed very strong feelings for him and attachment , we would talk a lot and get food even after the sex or intimacy so there was lots of time to bond. But the off and on contact was killing me , he finally decided to end things last week. 

So fast forward to now  , I was trying to grind past the pain like I always do, I really missed him and still do, I tried to confide in my family they just laughed in my face , they said I was just infatuated. I’m at work and am a cashier, I hate my job. I was having a very bad start to the day. My manager yelled at me as I was handing someone change , all of a sudden I couldn’t control my breath my whole lungs gave out I was gasping for air between tears. I ran outside and fell to my knees , I could not breathe. I have had panic attacks before but this was above anything I have ever experienced. A ambulance was called and I was taking to the ER. I was given an ekg amidst other things the doctor concluded he would keep a watch on me. Since then for a whole month I get cardiovascular pain in my chest and can’t stop crying every day , I just collapse mentally, get winded easily. The doctor diagnosed me with takosubo and has said if I don’t try to make mental and health changes there is a possibility of heart issues in the near future and premature death, he literally told me as a doctor I needed to stop working. So I only work one day a week right now which is horrible for finances. I often wonder why I am here, things are so much harder for me than other people it seems.

"I feel like an insane mental patient. I feel like I am going crazy. Insane even. I've always had anxiety, but never THIS badly. For the past maybe 1-2 months, I've noticed my anxiety start to increase. more. then even more. This ENTIRE past week since last Sunday, I've had horrible gut wrenching anxiety like never before. I feel like something is seriously wrong with me. The thing is, nothing has even caused most of it. I just get anxious, then scared, then I feel sick, etc. It goes on. I start shaking and can't remember much. It's like I'm having a bad episode for no literal reason. I have no idea what to do, my anxiety feels like it's just caving in on me, I feel like I can't escape it. When I'm having these bad anxious moments, even the littlest things that happen will trigger me and make me start breathing heavy, shaking, feeling crazy, and especially overthinking. I have never in my life had anxiety this bad. I like, crashed out last night and had an almost 2 hour long ""anxiety episode"" or whatever the fuck happened. I couldn't think straight at all and made irrational decisions. It was like being manic except negatively. I also kept heavily overthinking about my relationship. I was at my boyfriend's house for a few hours, but I was also tired and a bit nervous so I didn't talk a whole lot. My anxiety kicked in and after I left I SWORE he was gonna break up with me. He didn't. But i'm still overthinking about it now. I know he loves me but I don't know what my problem is. I just want to be okay. This anxiety shit gets bad, but when something also provokes it more it gets 100x worse and I start having a freak attack for 1-2 hours. Another example is when Friday (can't really remember because this shit has been fogging my memory hella) my friend texted me and said he needed to talk to me about something, that scared the living shit out of me so I locked myself in the school bathroom for almost the entire class and cried begging my friends to come down, but they couldn't. Another time was I think Thursday morning, I just started freaking out for no reason and was so anxious I just wanted to die. It was horrible. I don't even know what's wrong with me. I just need somebody to tell me what's wrong with me. I'm a 14 year old boy I don't know why I'm feeling such heavy agonizing feelings and emotions.

"Tight face.  My anxiety has been fine. Sure some more than average stress. But lately I've had alot of tension in my face.

"Intrusive thoughts as a parent I didn’t experience what I knew to be anxiety attacks until I was an adult in my 30s - I consider myself lucky I was mentally blissfully naive before then, a lot more carefree and had fun in my teens and twenties.

When I became pregnant with my first child I was strangely calm throughout the pregnancy and never experienced many anxious thoughts or physical symptoms of anxiety. I guess it was a hormonal perk.

Afterwards though I did have PPA and slowly got better as my baby grew stronger. However I still have crazy intrusive thoughts that seem to come in waves, some weeks more than others. They are so much worse than any intrusive thoughts I had about myself or my family getting hurt or dying. Now that my child is my number one priority I just have to fight off terrible thoughts about something happening to her, or something making her suffer. One of the recurring themes is if my husband and I suddenly died in some terrible way and she was left alone and devastated until someone found us and then traumatized while growing up with our family members who would take care of her.

I know I should be focusing more on gratitude that we are all healthy and have a loving family and stability. But I’m just plagued by these worst case scenario thoughts. I don’t know what I fear more.. losing my child or me dying and leaving her without a mother.

Any other parents out there struggling with this? I have a therapist and she helps me talk through the fears but new ones constantly arise and some fears really can’t be rationalized because they are such worst case scenarios that anyone would fear.",-1.0,anxiety

"A bit scared Hi, I used to post on here a lot but the past year and a half I actually have been doing pretty well mentally since starting lamotrigine! I’m currently at 200mg and I managed to hold a steady job the entire past (school) year. 

I still had many bad times, panic attacks now and then, trouble going out into public without freaking out, convinced I was sick with stuff etc… but it was entirely manageable.

Last month I got hired at a new job and was spending my last month of vacation having fun (Trying to). But as the month moved on I started having pretty bad anxiety and panics more frequently and stronger. 

Recently (last week) I started the new job with a lot more stake and involvement than the last because I felt as tho that was a good next step in life. I actually moved to this job (20 mins from my parents home) and have my own little apartment.

So ever since a few days of moving in I realized I was having really scary intrusive thoughts that I couldn’t get over. Stuff about hurting my cat or a loved one (specifically things I really really care about) they kept coming and I would think about them all day. 

So now here I am at this new job and the last few days have been unbearable. I feel anxious in a brand new way that makes me feel like I want to scream and cry the whole time. I’m getting these intrusive thoughts so often I still haven’t had my cat move in with me. Ive been begging to see my psychiatrist for days but they can’t get me sooner than Friday (5 days away) and I don’t know what to do. My anxiety is so bad and I really can’t afford to lose this job if I enter a manic episode or psychosis (I am recovering from a breakdown in 2023)

So today I’m just at a breaking point of sorts. I feel so overwhelmed and paranoid that I’m going to go crazy/snap and it feels so real, but I know that it’s unlikely logically. I can’t afford to lose this job it’s an amazing opportunity, I’m just not sure what to do.

"The Power of Negative Thinking + Setting My Intentions Whenever I’m not doing anything that requires a ton of focus or mental effort, I tend to find myself daydreaming. More often than not I tend to imagine a lot of negative things, such as people not liking me or something bad happening to a loved one. I know somewhere inside that these thoughts are not rooted in any truth, but the feelings that they elicit are very real. 

Sometimes I try to remind myself to think positive thoughts, but it never has as much of an effect on me as the negative thoughts do. Since I can’t simply stop with my daydreams, I think my best course of action is to try catching myself in the midst of these negative thoughts, acknowledge the lies and damage within them, and shift my thoughts to something productive.

On another note, I want to set my intentions. I tend to keep my thoughts and feelings to myself, only opening up to family whenever the floodgates feel like they are cracking. This year I have seen a  sizable regression in my journey with anxiety/depression and I honestly feel like I’ve been at my lowest. However, I still have a desire to improve. I think a decent way to start is to open up a bit more and use Reddit as an outlet to share how I’m feeling instead of keeping everything bottled up inside. Even though there is a comfort in sharing from behind a keyboard, I do have self-doubt and anxiety in posting this. Aside from having an outlet, I also think regular posting will keep me accountable in my journey. I’m going to challenge myself to post something (whether it is a comment or a self-post) on here or r/socialanxiety at least once a day. Furthermore, I’m going to attempt to keep my posts relatively positive or at the very least geared towards finding ways to make progress.

"How does one even see a doctor? This is a funny post haha. 

Basically, I'm 19 (just turned), and have never been to a doctor before (except once when I was 4 lol). My mom is very distrustful of doctors, I'm not even vaccinated. 

5 days ago, I accidentally took an edible. I would have never taken it if I had known what it was. I have a family history of schizophrenia and have always been sorta paranoid/anxious, I suspected it would do bad things to me. Almost immediately, I had a panic attack that lasted more then 3 hours. I thought I was dying, it was the worse I've ever felt. 

I was hoping it would be a 1 time, drug induced thing... but today I almost had another one. I managed to calm myself down, but it was scary. 

I want to go to the doctor, I'm worried I might need medication. However I literally do not have one. And my mom doesn't really seem to think I need one either, and I don't want to try to deal with her. So I'm just asking here... how do I even begin to go about this?

"Extreme health anxiety, I think it's time to see a doctor. Please help. 🙏 
I will try to not make this too long.

I am a dancer and I was very anxious about an upcoming event and training several hours in the heat.
At the  beginning of July I experienced a bunch of weird symptoms.
It started with urinary incontinence, fatigue, and then one night, suddenly my stomach started with these weird growling noises and then there was this *really* weird smelling, peanut butter colored diahrrea with a blob of mucus. It really freaked me out. It lasted about 24 hours and had lots of undigested food.
After that, it stopped, but for 2 weeks when I had to go it was more loose and very light, yellow brown.
The color and consistency went back to normal, mostly. 
But sometimes I have constipation, bloating, gas after dinner. 
I usually poo in the morning and feel good for several hours.
Lately after 6 hours or so I sometimes have an urge but then it is just gas and some mucus. Sometimes when I drink water I can then poo.
Recently had a small gynecological infection, no big deal, and bladder infection, possibly to not drinking enough.
Also suffered from pins and needles for a while, but this went away. Incontinence went away also. 

Anyway, I'm really scared about these digestive issues and mucus gas and I want to see a doctor. Any ideas how to not go completely crazy when I go?
Waiting for my urinary test and going to get the gynecological thing checked even made me panic even though the outcome of a uti and small infection was pretty clear.

The only thing that calms me a bit is that it all started with the diarrhea - likely some sort of stomach bug - and I hear more serious issues come more gradually not suddenly like that.

But I'm still so scared.
How can I manage?

Travel/Highway anxiety  To preface I have been on antidepressants and have struggled with anxiety since I was 9. I am now 26 and throughout my life my anxiety has always latched to different things. I recently entered into a relationship with someone who lives around 3.5 hours away. I’ve always hated the idea of being “in the middle of nowhere” or apart from where someone I know could help me if I needed it. It is hard to explain the logic because there is a lack of it but I seem to have the hardest time driving alone on a highway. I psych myself out and become lightheaded and panicky as I convince myself that there is no way to get the help I need if I’m traveling alone. The illogical aspect is that being on the highway or backroads make no physical difference to me. It’s is purely my mental causing me to feel as though something is wrong. The person I am in a relationship with is someone I love deeply and the last thing I want is for my relationship to suffer because I can’t face these fears.

(the home invading is mostly auditory, like hearing people talk outside but no one being there when i check, or people walking in my house when i'm alone/everyones asleep, and yes I checked if they were or got up).

"Getting surgery tomorrow, having mental health crisis Having my gallbladder removed. It’s a pretty routine surgery, but as the date approaches, I’ve been in a worse and worse place. The symptoms from my gallstones have gotten constant. I’ve been barely eating for a month and a half, and in the last week even that tiny amount of food has gone down to basically nothing. Even drinking water is painful. I have to take the tiniest sips and spread them out, and even then it’s so hard not to vomit it up. Everything I swallow feels like lead in my stomach. I’m constantly nauseous.

And one of the worst parts of this is that I don’t know for sure which of these symptoms is from my gallbladder, and which are significantly worsened—or are completely caused—by my anxiety. I’m a complete wreck. Everything causes me painful, all encompassing dread. Reading. Scrolling the internet. Putting on the tv. Audiobooks. Any sensory input feels like it’s pushing my brain over the edge. I can’t sleep. Like at all. Even though I’m so tired. It’s like my body is fighting with everything it has not to let me fall asleep. If I start drifting off a wave of dread washes over me and I feel a sensation like stinging adrenaline spiking in my veins and it jerks me awake. I can’t escape my thoughts. They are all loud and painful. Happy memories feel like torture. I feel cut off from the world, and I don’t know how to cope with this pain.

I have no idea how I’m going to feel in the aftermath of the surgery. Which of the symptoms will resolve? How anxious am I going to be at that point? How bad is my post surgical pain going to be? What if I still can’t eat, drink, or sleep? How will I recover? How is it even going to affect my outcome that I’m going into surgery malnourished, dehydrated, and on 3 straight nights of zero sleep?

How is it even biologically possible that I’m awake right now?

Has anyone ever been in a similar place, especially with the severe lack of sleep, being jerked awake by sensations of dread? How have you dealt with it, or at least learned to cope with it? Are there any medications I could ask my surgeon about that could help?

I also had a really bad experience trying to take a hydroxyzine while this was happening. It made me infinitely more tired, dizzy, nauseated, but I still couldn’t sleep. It was nightmarish. Now I’m scared to take anything else to help me sleep. I’m on buspirone, but it doesn’t seem like it’s doing a whole lot at this point. Maybe just taking the edge off slightly.

If anyone read this far and has any advice, commiseration, or words of encouragement, I’d be so grateful. I’m completely mentally unraveling right now. I feel like I can’t get help with my mental state because I need to get this surgery and recover at home.

I’ve been very hesitant to try medication mainly because I’ve never taken medication for mental health issues and I’m afraid it’s going to turn me into an emotionless zombie, nor do I want to become dependent on it for the rest of my life.
But I’m to the point now where I feel like it’s holding me back in my life in a major way and I’m really tired of feeling this way.

"I stopped Lithium for a month because my insurance was terminated. After my Medicaid was terminated due to me completing school and being over 18. The Lithium cost alongside my other meds for related issues was 130$, I just got a job at that point and hadn't the money.  

After 2 weeks I felt not an issue until I was able to directly recognize and feel that I was unnaturally happy, I rocked excessively, I felt way too sexual, hyper-sexual if that is appropriate, I used Grindr excessively and had a lot of sex, regretful sex. I spent my entire first paychecks in days and though I am happy I got what I ordered, the money spent is gone.

I felt panicked and hyper-paranoid the entire time and was able to recognize the silliness of my actions after making them, but never wanted to stop, as if I was literally a machine.

"Fellow Bipolars Who Have Experienced Psychosis--What was your experience like? I read that First Episode Psychosis (FEP) has a high incidence of PTSD as a direct result (1 in 2 will develop PTSD symptoms and 1 in 3 will develop full blown PTSD) due to the traumatic nature of psychosis itself as well as treatment (hospitalization, 5150/5250, restraints, being given meds against one's will). It was relieving to read that my experience is so common, but it is a pretty tough statistic to swallow and I'm sure it makes treatment/management of symptoms more difficult for most.

I personally did experience some PTSD from my FEP and it actually has made me extremely med compliant, because I am terrified of ever having a psychotic episode again. I imagine people who have had meds forced on them might end up less med compliant and ppl who get 5150'd probably are less likely to report symptoms, but would love to hear peoples' experiences--good and bad

"Getting broken up with  Basically what the title says. My (ex?)boyfriend experienced me having my episode last week. I’ve been with him for a little over a year and have had bouts of depression, but nothing too serious, and have been stable for the most part. Last week I spiralled really badly, got extremely suicidal and said a lot of really hurtful things to him over text/call that I didn’t mean. He basically disengaged and turned off his phone, so I couldn’t really do much else except be extremely angry by myself and fall asleep out of sheer exhaustion.

I had mostly calmed down the next day and apologised profusely because I felt terrible, but he essentially told me that while he knows I didn’t mean it, he didn’t want to experience that again. He then told me he needed a while to decide whether he wanted to continue being with me, which didn’t help with my mental state at the time. I kind of got mad at him again, because I know it’s not an excuse, but I had been very explicit with him from the start about me being bipolar, having experienced psychosis before, and having several suicide attempts that landed me in the hospital.

Well, long story short, I had to wait a week for him to essentially break up with me over text. He told me that while he loved me, all his friends and family encouraged him to “break up with the crazy b*tch before you walk in on her dead”. 

I don’t really know what the point of me sharing this is, but I guess I just feel really alone. I know what I did was shitty, and he has every right to leave, but at the same time, I really wish he’d given me at least one chance. I know I’m young, but I’m so worried I’m going to fuck up every relationship of mine because of something I am trying my best to control, but just can’t. 

And a really selfish part of me is absolutely pissed at him/the situation, because I just feel like I’m expected to be perfect all the time and it’s not my fault he didn’t internalise the gravity of my disorder when I told him multiple times when we first got together. But this might be me just victimising myself idk.

"5150'd 3x, and after the last time I have this feeling I want to go back? I just recently learned from another's post that 5150 means an involuntary 72 hour psychiatric hold. I have had this twice, and a third time where I was voluntary but barely so-I knew I was close to being in psychosis and didn't have anywhere to go. I slowly became psychotic while in the holding place, but it was milder than my previous two. For instance when the staff approached me with injections I knew I had no choice so I complied, whereas before I was held down. 

I don't know why, I have felt at times that I want to go back in there. This is something I'll bring up with my therapist on Monday, but I thought maybe someone might relate. I don't know why I have the feeling of desiring to go back, and it's disconcerting. I recognize that part of me wants to be in there so that I can help calm some people who experience nad anxiety in there, because it was a really common occurrence, and often the people didn't even know any grounding techniques to help themselves with. Once I helped a woman who was basically appearing catatonic as her mind took over, she just stared wide eyed at the ceiling barely breathing and I was able to apply pressure to her hand and be with her, guide her breath, and saw her visibly relax a bit. One of the staff praised me for it, so maybe I'm just looking for validation like that again? But that seems very wrong of me to want that self satisfied feeling enough to go back to a hellscape. Part of me just wants to BE in there. 

I know, it's an awful place to be. So why would I want to go back? Any thoughts to maybe help validate the feeling would be helpful! Thanks for listening.",-1.0,bipolar

"Stopped taking my meds and I think I’m hypomanic Re-upload due to me accidentally naming the medications I was taking (I apologize mods). 

Hello all, I am not sure where to start. I started taking a new atypical antipsychotic about a week ago after I tapered off of my SSRI (was taking with a different antipsychotic but tapered off due to excessive sleep and not being able to function during the day). Since the night I started taking it I have had horrible stomach aches and pains in my chest as well as increased insomnia and horrible day-long headaches/migraines. I stopped taking it yesterday and I do not plan to continue taking it and have messaged my doctor about it. 

I believe I may be hypomanic because I was in a VERY deep depression and for the last 3 days (?) or so I have woken up with a pep in my step, the world is so much brighter, I have been able to get so many more things done and I have been spending a bit recklessly (about $250-300 in the last couple days). I have had more racing thoughts and I’m starting to feel the tingling in my body again that happened last time I was hypomanic (turned into mania that lasted 4 months or so). I did not realize that I was possibly hypomanic until I read another post on this sub and it clicked in my head. The only thing I am worried about is that I have had increased paranoia and have been seeing things again. I have been checking my vents and bathroom for cameras and have caught myself becoming more worried that my partner is reading my mind. This happened last time and turned into seeing full people crossing the street and sitting in the back of my car and I am not sure what to do about it. I can’t take the stomach ache and migraines anymore.

I feel like I’m not making any sense but I have an appointment on Wednesday with my new psychiatrist so I will be letting him know about my concerns. I know I am rambling and I’m not sure what I am hoping to come from this post but I needed to get it off of my chest.

They always shut down convos about my feelings, abusive household, etc and it resulted in me lashing out because I would bottle those feelings up. They aren’t my friends anymore.

Now that I am medicated, I can control my feelings. I just feel a damper on my mood about the way they treated me though. And that I couldn’t remain this calm while feeling sad/hopeless before.

"I think I had a manic episode  Hi, so the first major event I remember happening which was in the beginning of this year I had dropped out of my senior year of high school. Later ghosted my job (a job I NEEDED). Turned 18 then downloaded dating apps, started dating people, having sex with randoms. I spent TWO WEEKS at a random guys house who doesn't even live in the same state as me? Wtf. Drinking (blacked out twice)and/or smoking everyday. Spending money so foolishly. I shaved my head off. I lied to so many people about thingss I didn't need to lie about. I was partying like crazy and going to 21plus spaces. I was traveling so much and never home. I borrowed money from people with NO JOB and I have no clue how I was gonna pay them back. I got a credit card and MAXED IT OUT. 

There is probably so much more that I'm forgetting but yeah it was a crazy time and now I'm like at rock bottom. Super depressed and left reflecting on everything I just did and I don't understand why I did it. I know my life isn't ruined but I definitely set my self back and idk what to do and how to get over it. I'm currently avoiding most of the people I met during this time because I'm just humiliated and also just don't want any connections to the past few months.

"Manic depression or virus? Hey guys! I’m not sure if this would qualify as a trigger warning, but I’m throwing up one anyway. 

So, my husband recently lost his job. On top of that, both my parents are having health issues. My daughter has a mood disorder and hers has been extra bad lately.. probably because she can pick up on the stress, as well as we hide it. On top of that, I had to socialize for 2 days straight, which killed my social battery, including cooking dinner for 10 people. As soon as we were finished eating (this was on Monday), I got hit with severe exhaustion, body aches and headaches. This lasted until Tuesday. Wednesday-Friday, the aches were gone, but I slept a lot during the day and never felt rested.
Aches, nausea, and headaches have been coming and going. But the fatigue and weakness is the worst symptom. As soon as I am on my feet for half an hour at most, I lose all energy and strength and have to lay down for the rest of the day. 
Nobody else in my house is sick or feeling sick. I haven’t had any fevers with this. None of my husband’s family is sick. I’ve just been assuming it’s a weird virus.  
My husband is convinced I’m in a manic depression, but that’s it’s all coming out physical instead of mental. He also said this happened before a couple of years ago and that I was bedridden for 2 weeks. I’m starting to think he might be correct.

"Still healing from my first  My first real manic episode that I am aware of was almost three years ago. I don’t know how long it lasted because when I try to think back to it, tome feels all mixed up and I can’t piece together where what goes. Even these last three years since feels so hard to piece together sometimes. Like time hasn’t been moving right. I started medication to deal with it and started seeing a therapist. No one would acknowledge that time and when I’d tell him I was afraid it would happen again, he’d ask me why I’m worried about something that isn’t guaranteed. Which I followed with being diagnosed bipolar indicates to me that it wasn’t a one off. Point being, no one helped me understand. Nothing felt real and nothing existed. I truly believe that if I slipped further into that fake existence, I would have gotten seriously hurt. Ex: cars weren’t real so stepping in front of one wouldn’t hurt me. 

It’s been so long but I still get little blips of that derealization that scare the crap out of me. I still have a hard time accepting I went through that but also know that it can get much worse.

I had anxiety, a panic attack. Work is about to get stressful and I just can’t handle it. The depression is so bad. I’m not sure if it’s because of coming down from the mania.

"I know I’m crazy, but am I crazy? Hey folks. I’m writing about the joys and perils of being bipolar and in a relationship. 

I think this relationship has been a bit rocky for a while but I wonder if it’s because I’m the sorta person to be on the rocks. I should specify that this is the first big long-term relationship I’ve been in and I think it’s largely because, just before we met, I had been doing a lot of work on myself and getting psychological/psychiatric help, therapy, etc.

I’m an Irish guy, in a relationship with a Spanish guy. We met somewhere else but I ended up moving to Spain with him for an opportunity for him. I also thankfully found a great remote job so all good there.

When we met, I didn’t drink (as in, I had before and needed to stop). And towards the end of our first year together I started again. 

The last few years were tough for me professionally and personally and I ended up being diagnosed with bipolar. We had to do a semi-long distance relationship for a bit which was tough too, and when we were back living together there were a few moments where I was a bit crazy (just mad depression which made me hard to be around).

I think we’re mostly happy now, but he’s just very different to me. He doesn’t drink that much but I still like to, between once and twice a week. But when I do it’s definitely a session, I like enjoying it, watching tv, listening to music, smoking some cigarettes. And so often I get the cold shoulder from him afterwards. Even when I know I haven’t done anything or even said anything. It’s just sort of judgement and disappointment. 

And I don’t know what to do. I love him to bits and if I were to ever marry someone it would be him. But I couldn’t do a lifetime of this kind of judgement, of constantly worrying about whether I’m disappointing him, of being enough or worthy for him even with my faults. ",-1.0,bipolar

I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for several years now. 
I try to go at it through the physical angle of things like diet, exercise, going outside in the sun, walks, just being out to keep my mind focusing on keeping myself healthy.
Because of this, I’ve really gained a good control over the regulation of the episodes I go through.
I’ve learned to deal with the symptoms I may face on a day to day than seeing myself as an individual with bipolar disorder.

BUT, I think I’ve started to come into denial with it
I deny the fact I have bipolar disorder because sometimes I really don’t think I have it, but my loved ones think otherwise.
I don’t want to have these struggles and I don’t know what to do with them because I’ve handled all I can do physically, but emotionally I just can’t open up because I don’t like how intensely I feel.
I don’t know how to show anyone that side of me because I don’t wanna push anyone away.
I have been really struggling with rapid cycling emotions and they’re starting to get difficult to handle al͟o͟n͟e͟.

"No support from family I'm new to this sub so I hope this is allowed and not exhausted. I need some advice from others in this community. Mods, please let me know if this isn't OK and I'll change it to fit the rules (I did read them but want to be sure).

I have had a tumultuous relationship with my father and step mother. A lot of abuse on their part. We have been trying to mend our relationship. The other day, my dad asked me if how I'm doing and I told him the truth: I've been depressed (Bipolar 2 here) and have been for a long while. He asked me why and I didn't have an answer. He kept checking up on me which was great.

Here comes the dicey part. So we had breakfast today (the three of us) and he must have told my step mother about this, which was fine. I didn't mind that. Well, she proceeded to tell me that I am not bipolar, that it can be treated without medication and I have to ""surround myself with positivity"" and should seek therapy (it's on my list of things to do. My insurance is terrible atm). All of which are true. Except for the meds part. In her limited time taking psychology courses (she didn't end up majoring in it, but I did), she tells me that it's all about mindset and that I need to just need to retrain my brain and that she doesn't believe in psychiatrists and i don't need meds. I told her I've been diagnosed with it and she told me that she ""knows"" me (she has spent less than a total of 24 hours with me in the last almost 20 years) and that I don't have it and certainly didn't ""always"" have it. For context, after my diagnosis I realized that I always had it. I told her this but she insisted that I don't and never have. That I'm just ""manipulative"" implying I'm trying to manipulate my father. For...reasons? 

It's really frustrating having someone invalidate you like that. She was in college probably 40 years ago so her information is quite outdated. We have come a long way. I told her they did a blood test on me to find it out. I honestly don't remember but I know they DID do a blood test but idk if it showed it. I stupidly just said it. She grilled me for probably half an hour, asking me what my symptoms are and I need to do this and I need to do that. Bc of my past trauma, I froze like a deer in headlights and stumbled over my words.

I know I can't make her see it but how do you find works best to cope with this? I want to build a relationship with my dad but they are a package deal so I can't just avoid her. Any advice would be appreciated.",1.0,bipolar

"Losing My Way I hate that this post has to be contextualized by my condition, but it might be more helpful that it does.

Today I almost lashed out my boyfriend for some valid, but very small reasons. I fought very hard to  not send that initial igniting text and broke down when he responded to me with love on a message that was laced with a tinge of annoyance.

He was already having a bad day, and I thought about how easy it would've been to make his day worse through a self righteous episode. And I bawled and thought about how much I've lost my way since starting my journey with bipolar. 

Growing up I had deep desires to be a good, unselfish and understanding person. And while elements of that have certainly influenced my personality, making a stronger commitment to those values early on in my journey with bipolar is what gave me purpose.

Now I've opted out of public education, and gone into private education/sales/management, and my life is filled with charging a premium for education, and leveraging the pain of parents against them to keep sales high. I regularly have to make my directs feel less than in order to get them to meet the unrealistic expectations my boss has for the business.

I gave up on my public school kids, for which I bawled many nights, and I've just decided to soldier on and not reconsider my life and it's direction. I'm so focused on how I look, how my car looks, how I present, how my clothes are ironed, I've neglected my spiritual togetherness. I'm easier to anger over issues of vanity, of money, of time. I neglect my family.

I don't want this life. I don't want to do what everybody else does. I have someone who I personally know who was, up until recently, a CEO of a very large company. And he told of how lonely and soulless those months were. I keep striving to that goal, I keep pushing others out of my way to get higher on the totem pole, but I think that's going to be the end of me.

I definitely need to be medicated  I must have mixed episodes. Severe crippling depression episodes over 4 months to where I’ve probably missed 2 months of work of those 4. And I’m glad I have a fear of being in jail because when people trigger my agitation and anger making me manic I would’ve been in jail if not for my fear. My anger from my bipolar disorder is bad because I do NOT forget the people who’ve wronged me and think of them often.

"Mood swings worse than ever! ADHD & Bipolar?  Hi! I was diagnosed just over a year ago now w bipolar after some short hypomanic episodes. I only started experiencing mania after a few months of taking adhd medication (was diagnosed the year before the bipolar diagnosis). Doc said likely triggered by the stimulants so I don’t take anything for the ADHD now. 

For the last 3 months my mood swings have been getting crazy. I will cycle through at least 4-10 quick mood changes a day, every day. From extreme anxiousness/irritability, happy/overly excited, depressed and then spiral. During the “up” I can get a lot done/motivated, during the “down” I literally can’t do anything. 

I have not had a day without a few mood swings in months. 

Does anyone know if this is more of an ADHD thing than a bipolar thing? I don’t experience long-term mood changes at all. And I will almost 100% have a mood swing whenever I am going from one location to another. 

Is there anything that makes this better? I eat very well, exercise 2-3 times a week and I go for a walk in the sun every day. In a healthy relationship, I’m medicated, but none of that has helped the mood stuff.

"Ways to Cope with a Depressive Episode  Hi everyone so as the title says I am experiencing a relatively intense depressive episode. I am away from home and living with my friend. I have been on the job search for over a month now with no success. I am so stressed and it’s finally caught up to me. I am having issues getting out of bed and interacting with her and her family. She knows I am bipolar but has never witnessed mania or depression in me at least.

I have been doing what I typically do such as sleeping for way too long and not eating. My brain is attacking me and I can’t get it to stop. I tried going to the gym yesterday to get the good endorphins going like my doctor always suggests but it didn’t work. I had my music loud so I could focus but the thoughts were over powering. 

Not having a job is really damaging my self esteem and is making me depressed. I have been applying to jobs like a mad man and it’s not working. The job interviews I have had are sales jobs that doesn’t pay besides commission but I can’t survive on that. I have applied for over 70 jobs. Some using my degree and some just entry level jobs and I am getting nothing. I have three degrees and it makes me overqualified for some jobs and under qualified for others.

Yesterday was a huge trigger for me. I started the day and I was fine..

Cuz I could’ve sworn after three times now that I don’t get emails from here and I placed an order”  and I’m just getting livid. The more she spoke the more pissed I got and I couldn’t calm down.

Then, my friend group (who are also my coworkers) were acting weird with me all week and waited until yesterday to say something to me. Turns out, while I wasn’t working, they were all talking about the minor details of my living situation and decided that I was a liar because they all heard different things at different times. The three of them were talking among each other and decided I was a liar, so they cancelled plans with me and distanced themselves until they told me about it yesterday. And again, I was mad and I started yelling at them. I kept feeling the pot boiling and I was just getting heated that they would ever disrespect me like that and then say I’m overreacting over something small. It couldn’t have been that small if they were debating on ending our friendship.

"Completely overwhelmed by adult daughter's CPTSD Throwaway acct for privacy. My daughter is 21 years old. I adopted her as a 4 year old who already had complex trauma from years of sexual abuse by many of her bio relatives. I have background in working with trauma and I am also a survivor of CSA myself. My daughter was in therapy from age 7 on as she processed all that she remembered. first play therapy, then art therapy and finally work with a trauma specialist starting at age 12. She was doing really well. neither her therapists, doctors or I realized she had DID, but it became evident when, at age 15 she was found to be engaging in a very dangerous relationship with an adult male 9 years her senior. She was so adept at hiding this relationship It is shocking. After a few months into this relationship, she got in over her head and I found out because she was actively suicidal.

It turns out. She engaged in some horrific things and relived much of her violent trauma with this man. She had been secretly meeting him afterschool when she was supposed to be at a special study hall at her school, but then she shared where we lived and she met him at a park near our home on weekends when I was working. This man ended up beating, strangling and raping her and did other tortuous horrible things to her. it has taken me years to come to terms with myself, so I cannot imagine what it is like for her. Anyway, we have walked this road of healing for over 5 years now. She has done every form of therapy that might help. she's done in patient programs, EMDR and the like. She has two therapists she still sees weekly and she has a diagnosis of not only CPTSD but also DID now.

Here is the issue. She is still needing tremendous help with getting thru life and I am utterly exhausted. I have poured all I have into her healing and, before that, giving her the best childhood I could. I am now in my mid 60s and my health isn't great and I am so burned out from not only raising her but helping her through this recent trauma, I find it hard to support her with basic things she still wants help with. She cries most days about anything that doesnt go according to plan, she rages about life being unfair, she does little to move forward, and I understand. It's HARD. However, she is becoming resentful of the fact that I no longer run to her aid for every little thing. I'm trying to help her grow up. but she rages and threatens to end her life when I'm not being the mom I was in her childhood. She says all the time she doesnt want to grow up and she'd rather just die. She'll have good days here and there, but overall she's not making progress. I've informed her therapists many times, but nothing changes. I am starting to feel so worn out that I have found myself daydreaming about being dead myself. I mean, not planning to kill myself, but just imagining the relief when I eventually die.

This is not the life I imagined for myself or my daughter. I worked so hard to help her and in some ways it feels like she threw everything away when she got involved with the man who eventually raped her. ( Its a VERY long story I can't get into here, but ,yes, police and law got involved, but she was too traumatized to go to court, so they had to drop everything.) Anyway, What can I do to keep myself relatively sane while meeting her needs but not doing everything for her? I feel so lost and alone. I just don't see an end to this life of caring for someone who won't do much for herself.

"I would be a mother of a toddler. 17F. Graphic details of misscarige I don’t like to think about it much. I try to ignore it. Pretend it didn’t happen. I’ve not told anyone ever in my personal life about the pregnancy.

I got raped at 14. It was my fault really. I was depressed because of bullying and past rape. So I started getting into drugs. And one of my dealers raped me. 

I started showing the signs but was scared to take a test or tell anyone. It was a few months before I built up the courage to take a pregnancy test. I wasn’t allowed to leave the house on my own because I had attempted suicide a week after the rape (before I started to think I was pregnant). So I asked my friend to meet me in town a week after as if it was just going to be to hangout and I was planning on stealing a pregnancy test without her noticing. 

In my head though I knew I was pregnant. I had a lot of pregnancy symptoms and I had a pregnancy belly. I was even lactating and didn’t have a period. So I had accepted I was most likely pregnant. And I started to feel somewhat comforted. I felt like maybe the baby would make me feel less alone. I started to imagine what names I would pick all that. Even though when I first started suspecting I was pregnant I thought for sure I would have an abortion. But I started weirdly being attached. I started looking after myself better. Because I didn’t want to hurt the baby more than I already probably had from the suicide attempt and the drugs and alcohol.

But a few days before I was supposed to go to town I started having extreme stomach pain and started bleeding suddenly. Not like usual. I always had a really heavy period but this wasn’t like that. Within second I underwear was completely soaked through and dripping down my leg and I was in agony. I called my mother and she said it’s probably a really heavy period and gave me this really thicc pad thing. I crawled to the bathroom because I could barely walk and felt like I was going to faint. And actually thew up before actually being able to put the pad and new underwear on but once I was on the toilet there was parts of the feetus in broken up parts. I could make out some of its limbs. 

I flushed it away. I wish I kept it. So I couldve buried it. But I was so ashamed. I thought everyone would hate me. And they’d tell the police and the police would get me in trouble for doing drugs in the first place.

I went through it all with no one. I had a bath and pretended none of this ever happened.

I’ve been trying to forget. And sometimes I do. But when it comes back it hits me like a ton of bricks. I could have a toddler right now. My life would be completely different. Maybe I wouldn’t be so depressed now. Or maybe it’s for the best. Truthfully I know it was for the best. But it hurts. I feel like if I didn’t try to kill myself or do drugs id have a toddler. It would’ve been tough but my parents would’ve helped obviously I would’ve been a single mother. I wouldn’t be in school right now. The mistakes I’ve made since would’ve been detrimental. But maybe I wouldn’t have made mistakes quite so big. 

I went off the rails after the baby passed away. I didn’t care anymore. Nothing mattered. I know it’s delusional but I thought this baby was a sign. That I wasn’t supposed to kill myself. My purpose was to raise my baby. But then it was gone. Still to this day I can’t talk about it. It’s my deepest darkest secret which NO ONE knows.

"How to overcome paranoia after a uninvited family member sneaks into your home? One of my family members doesn't understand boundaries so they recently snuck into my home while I was away.  They had an old key that I lent them, that I haven't had the chance to ask for back - as they stayed with me during a transition period in their life - which is also when I learned they have no concept of boundaries.  I would be ok if they told me before hand that they wanted to swing by but not cool when they come in without me knowing while I am at work - AFTER they moved out and got their own place and moved their stuff out.

So I changed the locks, told them not to do that again but the paranoia, is still there that they'll get bored and try to break in.  They have a repeated history of not understanding boundaries - even after it being verbally or writenly communicated to them, and they aren't the type that actually seems to know what happiness is and have goals and stuff they enjoy doing or are working towards, so I very much wouldn't be surprised if they try to break in out of sheer boredom.

"I keep kicking my partner outta bed at night Additional CW: Mentions of SA and DV

I (41NB) have a history of being SA’d while asleep - first when I was in the military. It continued in an abusive and groomed relationship for several years. My trauma lined me up for other partners to do similar things. 

I have a history of night terrors, nightmares, insomnia and sleep walking - I use marijuana to not remember my dreams. The medication class prescribed for nightmares (like Prazosin) make it so my AFAB body can’t climax. And that’s important too (I told that to a psych doc. His face was priceless - but he agreed)

So: I lived alone for about 3 years - and my wonderful, amazing and supportive partner (42 NB)  moved in 10/23. I think I forgot how to sleep with someone.

I now have the issue of “kicking my partner out of bed”  (my words, not theirs at all) - sometimes I throw elbows and punches, sometimes I literally push them out of bed, and sometimes I start snoring EXACTLY when they come to bed. I know *why* this is happening - but - this person is wonderful, and I want i to stop. I feel terribly guilty every time.

Anyone have tips to help me stop light weight assaulting them while I am sleep?

I currently use: a 20lb weighted blanket and a mantra of “(name) is supposed to be here - if they shake me it’s because I’m snoring - listen to them. If you kick them out of bed you have to sleep on the couch “

It’s kinda working (from once every 10 days to almost 3 weeks). Anyone have anything better to try that isn’t literally strapping me to the bed with a cpap? (The VA will soon provide that haha)

"It's a long story (cw: abortion, stillbirth) I'll try to concise, but there's been a lot on my mind leading up to this post.

I already had a diagnosis of psychotic depression and anxiety before I ever got pregnant. I had an iud in because I knew I wouldn't be a good parent and I know I can't handle it. 

Well, my iud failed. And honestly, I didn't notice. On top of the mental health issues, I have chronic pain and fatigue and a long/irregular cycle, so every pregnancy symptom, even the daily vomiting, wasn't something I could put to a pregnancy.

I started having some pretty bad uterine cramps that were impacting my daily life, so I made an appointment with my gp to discuss and get a pap smear while I was at it. The soonest appointment was more than a month out, so I just lived with the pain and waited.

And finally it was May 13th, the day of my appointment. I walked the three miles there. 

I had put together an idea in my mind that I had a cyst, or even cancer, because a pregnancy just wasn't possible in my mind. I was wrong, of course, and the doctor even did two urine tests to really confirm, and then he told me he was ordering an ultrasound stat, because the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy was very high. 

I was on the phone with my partner immediately. We both already agreed that termination was the answer, ectopic or not. The iud was there for a reason, we weren't interested in parenthood. I'm not here to argue the politics of abortion, and it's far too late to complain about mine now - if you comment or message me about it, I'll block you so please don't even bother. You saw the title, you knew this was coming. 

The doctor sent me to have a blood draw to confirm the exact length of pregnancy. I get my ultrasound scheduled for the 15th. I walk to my job to discuss the situation with my boss and tell her that I'm probably going to need some unexpected time off, and she drives me back to my house. 

The next day (May 14th) the bloodwork comes back to show 4 to 6 weeks. That's an easy termination, just a pill. 

My partner is with me for every appointment from this point on. We get up at 5am on the 15th, because the ultrasound is three cities away and we need to take the bus to be there by 9. 

And everything goes to hell from there. Its not ectopic for one. The ultrasound puts me at 27 weeks plus 1 day, which you may note is just past the legal abortion timeline in my area. 

A lot went on behind the scenes that I couldn't tell you about. My doctor gets in touch with me shortly after the ultrasound to talk about my results and inform me that he's found a clinic that will do my termination and gives me their number. He informs me that the legal time limit is not applicable because he is telling me that based on all my lab results he is recommending that a termination happen as soon as possible.

So I make my phone call. The clinic already has me scheduled in for May 17th and 18th, before I even got in contact with them. Because of the laws, my surgery will necessarily be out of pocket, and they quote me 10k, and refer me to two different charities.

And so I continue making phone calls. My partner is next to me the whole time, even as I pace the length of our little house. 

One of the charities accepts my application and tell me they'll get back in touch with me after they've spoken to the clinic for my full case. Four hours later they get back to me to tell me that they'll be paying the full cost, plus travel and hotel, including my partner coming with me. I try not to spend too much time thinking about how dire everything must be for everything to be going so quickly and for all these people being so willing to get this operation done. 

So we spend the 16th getting ready, because I need to be in a city two hours away the next morning. 

We wake at 3am. We finish packing, and we head off to the big city. 

We're lucky again in that the hotel let's us check in early. The clinic is two blocks from the hotel, and my partner walks me there. 

The first appointment goes very well. This appointment involves doing a few things that will prepare my cervix for the real operation, and they send me on my way with a fistful of prescriptions and a warning that my water might break. One of the doctors gives me a phone number to use in case of emergencies.

It takes us three pharmacies to get all the pills, and we decided to tourist for a little bit since we didn't get to come to the city often, but I'm exhausted and in pain, and we head back to the hotel to sleep the day off. 

So at about 10pm my water broke. I let the doctor know and went back to sleep. Around 3am I snapped awake again and all of the luck of the last week had gone right out the window.

I was in pain. More pain than I've ever felt in my whole life. I think about calling 911 but convince myself that I should just take a shower instead and see if that helps make it easier. 

It doesn't, and I spent the shower sitting on the floor and rocking back and forth. I found myself running on instinct and went to the toilet. 

It felt like a bad shit. But when I strained, the sensation came from the wrong hole. I reach down to touch the object and I didn't realize what I was feeling until I found toes, and of course I started screaming at that point because I was very suddenly in a horror movie. It was coming out, and backwards at that. 

My partner couldn't hear me through the bathroom walls, the air was on, and we always sleep with the TV on. My partner was unfortunately unreachable in those first horrible moments, so I called the number the doctor gave me and kept screaming. 

I hysterically explained to the doctor what was going on and finally my partner came running into the bathroom. This is the point where my memory gets bad. I know my partner held my hand. I know the doctor appeared in our hotel room in person. I remember when my partner had to leave to go get him from the lobby, because the minutes that I was alone were awful. I remember the doctor talking me through how to push through the contractions and how to pull on the body at the same time to make it go faster. He'd come straight to us from his own home and didn't have any medical gear with him, so he didn't touch me, just stayed with me. I must have been some kind of sight, naked and covered in blood on a toilet. 

I remember how the head got stuck and how hysterical that made me, but finally the body came out and then I had to wrap my fingers around the umbilical cord to get the placenta to detach. I have a very visceral memory of how it felt when the placenta did come out. The birth took about 45 minutes. 

My partner got me moved to the hotel bed and  I am forever sorry to the housekeeping staff of that hotel. There was blood everywhere.

It was actual hell to leave that body in the toilet. There is a video online somewhere of a doe pacing and crying around the body of it's stillborn fawn and that's how I felt and that's how I still feel. Like an animal that has lost everything. 

I made a terrible mistake. While the doctor was gone to go get medical supplies, I went back into the bathroom to check the gender. I will forever regret going back to see the lifeless body of my son that way. I would scrub that knowledge away if I could. 

I went back to the bed and passed out. The doctor came back and took away the body.

I kept my day two appointment, just to have my body checked out to make sure there was nothing left inside of me. 

And then it was all over and we were in a car being driven home. 

I cried for weeks. I cried when I started lactating.  I cried when my first period came. My cycle just makes me insanely anxious now. I got a new iud put in as soon as I could, but I know all too well that they can fail and I have taken a pregnancy test every month since it happened. 

Despite all that, I live in paranoia that I could be pregnant without knowing. Every cramp sends me into a nauseous spiral. My most recent period was late. Even though it did eventually come, and even though the test was negative I have been so unable to cope with the late period that I'm seeing a doctor soon  for another test to be absolutely sure that I'm not pregnant. 

My partner and I have had sex a handful of times since the stillbirth, but we've both agreed that it doesn't feel very good right now. We've discussed the concept of abstinence, and I think that's how we're going to be for a long time, until one or both of us can be sterilized. The thought of sex just scares me shitless right now. I have nightmares a lot of the time now. Luckily I can't remember them most of the time. 

Sleeping feels impossible most nights. I find myself unable to speak to my partner most days. I can't look at babies in public because I just break down. I get these twitches in my uterus that I understand are phantom kicks and they make me miserable. 

Other things have gone wrong since the stillbirth and I've had to start working more hours. I no longer qualify for free Healthcare, and haven't been able to afford my antidepressants. Bad timing. I cant afford to see a therapist or a psychologist and I just have to grit my teeth and make it through on my own. 

I've been suicidal, especially lately. I feel so much guilt and fear. Most days my stillbirth is all I think about. 

I feel like a monster. I feel like a failure. I feel useless. I'm terrified of pregnancy and can't cope with the idea of it happening again. I'm sick with worry that I'm going to find out that it's happening all over again when I go to the doctor soon. I can't afford the pill if I am, so I definitely can't afford a baby.

Despite my period coming and my last test being negative, and the fact that we haven't had sex in like three weeks, I'm living in terror. My partner is completely willing to cut sex out of our relationship and I think that's what I want for now. Or forever. I don't know. I'm just so scared. 

I've been trying to journal. I don't really know how else to cope. I don't have much focus for anything these days. It took me three hours to type this post because I kept zoning out. 

How do I stay grounded? How do I find myself again? I'm so lost. It's hard to eat. I keep forgetting to shower. All I do it sit on the couch and flip through youtube. I don't know how to have hobbies anymore, there's just no desire. I don't know how to engage with my partner because I feel like such a burden. I don't know how to maintain intimacy without sex. I'm afraid that we're just going to end up as roommates and that terrifies me almost as much as another unwanted pregnancy. 

I've had to go through all the post-birth pain and I don't even have a baby to show for it because he's fucking dead. He was going to die even if I hadn't had the abortion. I was going to die if I didn't have the abortion. 

But I gave birth to him anyway. I held his tiny body. I pulled him out of my body. 

I don't feel human anymore. I don't know how to feel human anymore. I just feel like that doe. It hasn't even been four months. I want to move on. I want to forget what his cold skin felt like. I want to forget the sensation of the placenta detaching. I want the phantom kicks to stop. I can't handle the way his ghost won't let me rest. 

What do I do if my doctor's appointment ends up with the worst case scenario again? I can't do it a second time. I just can't. There's literally no evidence that I'm pregnant right now, but I am so paranoid and so afraid. It's just cramps because of the new iud.  I'm so scared. 

Thanks for making it this far. I'm sorry if it was too much for you. It was hard to write, but I think it helped to get it all out.",-1.0,ptsd

"TW - SA - PTSD - Need advise with helping my daughter support and understand her partner who has just been diagnosed PTSD Hi everyone, This is my first post here and I’m
doing my best with this post, I don’t want to upset anyone with things I say, this is new to all of us.  I’m trying to help my daughter (20) with her boyfriend’s (19) PTSD diagnosis.  He had a really bad PTSD attack 9 weeks ago (he didn’t know what was going on, he didn’t realise he had PTSD) he had psychosis with it, he was using medical marijuana in excess to help with sleep.  After his attack he disclosed to family and us  that he was assaulted 6 years ago.  To follow he was ok with us and my daughter, he reduced the amount of MMJ and was wanting to see a psychiatrist and psychologist.  he has slowly started to smoke more and has pushed us and my daughter away (also his dad who doesn’t know anything about the last couple of months or what happened to him).  We love him so much and want to help him but we don’t know how.  My daughter is heartbroken (they have been together 4 years and they are really good together ) he cant be near her and hardly messages her.  I told her it’s not about her, he just can’t deal with much right now. He wells up when he sees me and is clearly anxious.  He is t seeing friends, but manages to work ( he told me it keeps him occupied and keeps his mind of things) His mum is beside herself and has basically handed the reins over to me to help him, she isn’t good with communication and just doesn’t know what to do.  He told me he doesn’t want to talk and that it’s just going to take time.  He has refused, doctors and therapy.  Any advice for me or my daughter would be greatly appreciated.  He is such a beautiful young man, we are all very worried about him and so sad.  Thank you for

"3rd day on lexapro thinking of quitting Hi I started Lexapro 3 days ago and I’ve had positive things like my rumination has decreased and I’m not reliving the trauma again and again throughout the day (just a few times)

But I’m extremely anxious, I had already anxiety (I was not depressed) but now is increased, I’m very nervous and I have to take 0.5 ativan to sleep. I’m also nauseous, dizzy and It’s difficult to focus.

Did Lexapro help you? Did anyone have those symptoms and have to quit?

I was planning on doing EMDR with my psychologist while taking some medication to help because I was fight or flight all the time, feeling everything is danger and also started to be afraid of my own trusted friends.

I’m very happy and thankful with rumination improvement, I feel like the past is more in the past and it’s not part of the present completely, that gives me hope to be myself again but the side effects.. and being more nervous and anxious… I wanna quit..

"Did anyone feel like AA didn’t work out for them if they also struggle with substance abuse issues? So, I’m someone who has struggled with addiction along with my PTSD. My PTSD was the main driver for my substance use issues. I’m now sober from everything except cannabis as it helps a lot with my PTSD. 

I tried AA for 3 years and tried 7 different sponsors. It just didn’t work for me. I would hear things all the time like “the root cause of our disease is selfishness and self-centeredness”. I wasn’t either. In fact, my trauma made me people please and put others above me to a high degree. “You are not the main character.” We are the main characters of our lives in my opinion, but we must also consider others and not be selfish also. I never thought I was better than everyone else. I never jived with the God/higher power concept as an atheist. Some of the rudest comments I’ve heard from people and badly ended friendships also came from my friendships in AA. Plus, most people in AA would frown upon my cannabis usage even though I’m using it for my PTSD and other trauma related disorders.

I’m just upset that I wasted 3 years pushing myself and shaming myself all to realize that it wasn’t necessary. That proper mental health treatment and social support is what got me to where I am. ",1.0,ptsd

"Is there anything I can do now to help myself? Suffering from flashbacks from sexual trauma and it has really wrecked my life. I had severe trouble sleeping until a psych prescribed Mirtazapine but that hasn’t completely stopped the flashbacks.

Where I live in Germany there are strained resources and almost no therapists available. I’ve contacted 80 at this point and nobody can help. Called the crisis line and unless I have plans to hurt myself, there is no capacity. I am not struggling with thoughts of self harm, I am just desperate to stop this suffering somehow and want professional help.

The best bet I have is being on a waiting list for an inpatient program, but that will be at least 1-3 months waiting period.

What can I do in the meantime to try and cope with this? The flashbacks have recently gotten so much worse and it is really hard. I’m reading the body keeps the score and finding it useful.

"Daylight makes me depressed. Not sure if this is the right place to be talking about it, but I have an idea that it might be, I don't know.

Unlike so many people, I hate sunshine. Daylight, being awake during the day, having a nice bright day with clear skies - it makes me so depressed. The daylight reminds me of all the things I should be doing but I am not. It makes me feel like I should be productive and doing stuff, but I am not. I hear all the people frolicking outside and doing all sorts of fun activities, but I am not.

It burns my eyes. It makes it abundantly clear just how poor, blurry and double my vision is. It shows me how dirty my room is because I don't clean enough. I watch the shadow of the tree branches, cast upon my walls, as they move with the wind and the sun glistens, and it makes me feel absolutely nothing short of horrible.

It is dark now, and I feel relief. The night, for me, feels like such a sigh of relief. The day is over. I no longer need to be ""productive"" - it's so much more quiet outside. The only sounds I'm hearing on a Saturday night is the distant, deep rumble of the bass from loud music playing at some party far away from me. It is still summer, so people are heard talking, sitting and relaxing on their terraces and balconies, until that sound fades too.

There is no pressure. Household members are slowly going to sleep. It is just me and my peace.

My eyesight adjusts. Finally, a relief for my eyeballs as well - no more poking them with hot, burning rays of light. I can breathe a little easier.

I hate the days, I love the nights. But this world forces me to live the other way around.

The night promises I don't have to do anything, I'm not forced to participate in anything, and I get to say I'll try again tomorrow, even though I probably won't. But it's night time, so everything is allowed.

I don't know what it is about the daylight that just works as the world's most effective anxiety booster for me. I am recovering from a several hour long daytime anxiety attack that wore me out completely. I am supposed to get more sunlight, for my health - how's this healthy?

"Work triggers cause me to lose my job Up until today, I was working in a barbershop. My boss pulled me aside about a week ago, and told me our owner had sent his ""secret shopper"" in, and that the secret shopper had told the owner that I asked if it was okay to shampoo his hair. She told me that the owner wants me to tell them we are doing a shampoo because it is included in the service, and that he doesn't want me to ask them. The owner says ""we are an upscale shop, people come in here for a high quality haircut and a shampoo."" I told my boss that I completely understand that, and that I had a traumatic experience with people playing with the back of my hair, and that I liked to ask consent because if I didn't consent to that and someone did it to me, it would really freak me out. My boss basically said that she didn't care and to do it anyway. The level of stress that this has caused me has made me be in panic mode non-stop for the week and a half since then, and the idea of going has made me physically sick enough that I had to call out two separate days. Today I sat down with her and said that I didn't want my anxiety to be a reason for me to lose my job, because I really loved working there. She said she wouldn't budge on the fact that I can't ask for consent, I just have to do it. I did one haircut where I didn't ask, and the whole time it made me panic and I had to fight off tears until my customer left, and it sent me into a very deep spiral.

"Is This Abuse? I'm going to be listing things that my parents did to me when I was younger. I'm not sure if these classify as abuse. Are these things that I should be diving deeper into and even cutting off my parents for? Help, I'm confused. TW!!!!!

* Age 14: I got out of the shower and I had a towel wrapped around me. I got into my room, closed the door and sat on the bed scrolling on my phone. My mom popped out of my closet and said something, but I don't remember what it was. I asked her what she was doing and she said she was trying to scare me and then she left the room. I'm forever grateful I didn't take my towel off.
* Age 7: I was sitting on my moms lap while she was on the computer and I looked at the screen and she was on some website sexting someone. I just remember seeing someone said ""what are you wearing"" and she replied ""nothing""
* Whenever I would hear my parents having sex I would panic and have a meltdown because of my sexual trauma. My dad never said anything, but my mom would come out of the room, grab my arm hard and take me back to my room yelling at me that I'm ruining her fun. I swear she would be loud on purpose so I would hear,
* When I was younger and even into high school, if I was afraid to sleep alone in my bedroom at night, I would try either asking my parents if I could sleep in their room or I would quietly make a little bed in the hallway. For some reason, this really angered my dad. There was one time where he just locked me in my room and made me keep the lights off. If I turned them off he would yell at me to turn them back on. I was hitting the door, banging on it, sobbing and asking to please be let out because I'm scared. When I got older, he didn't lock me in my room, but he would make me clean the entire house until I got tired enough to sleep.
* My mom would constantly walk around me naked, even when I asked her not to because I was uncomfortable with it. There were a couple times where I noticed while I was in the bathroom getting ready to shower, she would look in. I ended up making sure the door was locked every time I entered the bathroom.
* My mom showed me her sex toys and lube. 
* My mom would grab my boob or slap my butt on the basis of it being a joke 
* One time I had a boil (ew) on my butt (ew) and she literally wouldn't let me sleep in my own room. I wasn't allowed to have any underwear or pants on, not even a blanket and I had to lay on my stomach and she would take pictures of my butt stating it was for medical reasons.

"I Think I Have PTSD And I’m Terrified TW for mania and some parental drama

Without going into too much detail, I had a very hard period of my life back in April. I was already incredibly depressed in my first year of college, overwhelmed with academic and social stress. Then, my parents divorced. I knew it was coming for a long time, but I didn’t want to admit it. The next few days, my mother starts saying very weird things to me about spirituality and how everyone is secretly connected and how “they” are talking to her. I’m in college 3 and a half hours away from home, and I only talk to her through these phone calls where she’s telling me that she’s receiving all of these messages about the rapture. 

I wake up the next day with a message from my 14 year old sister. Apparently, my mom took her outside to “see the moon” and said all these disturbing things about spirituality to her. I was scared for my sister’s safety at this point, so, an hour before class, I call my mom to tell her that I’m worried about her. She starts screaming. Have you heard a manic person scream? It’s the most terrifying sound I’ve ever heard in my life. She tells me that she doesn’t love me, that I’m the only thing preventing her from being happy. 

I’m in ensemble rehearsal when I get a call from my dad. My mom was admitted to a mental hospital. They had to call 911. I wanted to see them, to see that they were okay. But I was 3 and a half hours away, and I had a wind ensemble concert tonight. So I stayed at college until the weekend. 

Things are better now. The doctors confirmed that my mom was in a manic state. She was in hypomania for another 2 months as college began to end. There was another episode in June where I was home and she started saying all these spiritual things to me again, but it wasn’t that bad. After all, I knew it was mania. Back in college, my first fear was that she was okay, was that she meant everything she said to me. After that, everything was okay again. She’s back to normal- no, she’s better than her normal. She’s happier, she stresses herself out less, she has contacts in case she has another episode. We have grown so close over the past few months, and I’m so eternally grateful to have my mom back. My dad and my mom got back together over the course of the last few months as my dad really began to step up. He was always a great person with pure intentions, but he’s recently really learned to listen to our problems and work to help us. I’m so grateful for the new him. 

Fast forward to this morning. I’m checking my rehearsal schedule for the next week, and, at the end of the announcement, my band director writes, “I wish I could write more, but I have to go attend to my daughter. It’s her birthday today! Happy practicing!” Something in me started to break. I thought of my dad and then the divorce and then my mom’s mania and then I was there again, back in class receiving the call that my mom was admitted to the mental hospital. I was in a state of panic for an hour before I successfully calmed myself down. Ive had flashbacks before, but this one just broke me. It’s been 6 months- why am I still thinking about this? Why do I feel this way? Why do I avoid everything that reminds me of the spring?

So I did some research and then it hit me: oh man I think I have PTSD. It feels so weird. For the last 6 months, I’ve been trying to convince myself that it wasn’t that bad. Lots of people divorce! I was just being sensitive. It wasn’t that bad, really. But can’t pretend it doesn’t hurt anymore. I feel weirdly healed and broken at the same time. I don’t really know what to do now, but I really just need to share this experience. Even just writing this has helped me a lot. Thank you for reading this far if you’re still here :)",1.0,ptsd

"relationship struggles Hello I’m 22(F) pretty new to this thread and wanted to share my experiences to know if anyone has similar experiences or feelings? I feel I’ve always struggled with making relationships with others whether it’s romantically or platonic..I grew up in a toxic household with my mum being bipolar and abusing me and neglecting me with various partners who she would put before me..I started get SA’d by family members as young as 6/7 I have really bad memory bc I was on survival mode sm of my life alone, I’ve always been told I’m attractive and equated it to love…I had an old therapist that said the reason I’m in constant abusive relationships stems from not having anyone and the only familiar relationship i know is abusive from my mum..so I would have short term relationships with men that abused me whether sexually/physically/verbally and lost a child to one when I was 18 that I feel for the past 4 years instead of enjoying college I’ve been in survival mode or “dissociating” i would hyper focus on someone just to have the pain go away just for it to add more…my old therapist recently last January convinced me to be with a guy who I had sexual relations with off the jump she would say “have fun, enjoy yourself” but I felt I was hurting myself bc I wanted to be viewed more than my body…i opened up the guy about my traumas and he acted sweet in the beginning then was saying I’m “too much” and said hurtful things that my mum would say to me but I thought he was the one so I stayed maybe bc the pain was familiar…he said he would never hurt me but constantly gave me mixed feelings, never officially asked me to be his gf for 8 months but pretended like we were together..long story short he would always say I needed to work on myself which I have and I tried but he felt bc he has no trauma that it was only me at fault in the relationship…so a month ago I sent him a paragraph telling him how I was done living in fear in this relationship and that I’ll let him do whatever bc I planned things he never got me flowers..and he said he broke he got tired of my nagging and so went three weeks without texting me, in the 4th week he flirted with me and had sex with me twice and spent the night while he was thinking of ending things with me which he blamed me for…two weeks ago I wanted him to go to ER with me bc I wasn’t sure if I was having a miscarriage and all he cared about was seeing if he was in the clear, it was a traumatic experience and he had sex with me when I was bleeding and he knew I felt violated..just to try to have sex with me two days later and try to break up with me just to ghost me…I feel so hopeless honestly that I’m in these continuous cycles of pain and each time I trust a man with my trauma he does me worse…I told him it hurt me what he did bc we spent almost a year together traveling, and meeting each others family just for him to do what he did at the end and not care…people think he was just using me bc he’d say things like “I love you” oh wait sorry nvm “I think we are meant to be” or I’ll try to leave and he’ll convince me to stay and that we will grow together…it hurts how I just want a normal relationship but idk if I’m capable of that I’ve never really had a real boyfriend I guess a healthy relationship where the guy actually asks you out, gives you gifts and treats you with love and respect…idk I’m here now blocked my mum for two months now bc I want to be healthy and happy but I know she’s a constant reminder of my failed mistakes as she’ll say “let be friends” “sorry I’m not the mother you want me to be” and it would set me back further…I’m just trying to find myself and be surrounded by loving supportive people…when I was 18 I went to college in person just to get away from my abusive mum n her partner just to meet a guy who was older and in the army who used my naiveness and innocence to his advantage and I was so mentally unstable I had to drop out of college and move back to the same town as my mum and abusers…It makes me so sad to think of what life would be for me if I just knew better at 18…would have gotten my degree and moved out of state probably with my best friend at the time…now I’m stuck and confused, and my dissociation is wearing off ti where now I feel like a complete failure): even the guy I just recently ended things with he shitted on me so badly when he used to uplift me…now I can imagine him living his best life being with other girls while I’m stuck reminiscing everything from my past including what he put me through.

"I have very strange behaviours that I struggle to understand I've gone through some traumatic events with the police. I know that I fit some of the criteria for PTSD but I have a hard time understanding other parts of the criteria. I have an appointment with my psychologist in about a month but I'm already trying to like gather my thoughts and understand my feelings and behaviours. I'm not looking for any form of diagnosis here, but I'd like to hear from people actually diagnosed with the disorder if any of you have experienced anythig similar.

Trying to make a long story short without going in to any specifics, I get extremely stressed around the police, and the closer they are to me or my home, the worse my mental and physical reactions will be. I know that a part of specifically PTSD is avoiding the trauma or that which reminds of it, and in some ways I absolutely do but on other ways I act the complete oposite. For example if the police show up in my neighbourhood, I will probably go out and like ""hoover around"" because I have a very high need of being in controll and knowing where they are. I can be out late at night after I have seen them around just going around and checking that they have really left. They way I'm acting is not really avoiding it. However, if they get too close to me physically, it will cause a huge stress reaction within me. I once ran from a police car a little while back because of this. 

Also when it comes to not trying to think about the trauma, at this point specifically, I'm absolutely the opposite but almost against my will. It's like I get sucked into a ""daydream"" about the traumatic events, sometimes directly from what actually happened, sometimes a variant of what could have happened if X Y Z etc. It's so strange because it feels like self harm, I get very disturbed by this and it makes me extremely anxious, but I can't stop. But it's not like I'm really trying to go against it either, I can't describe it more than it feels like a severe addiction? Sometimes I can walk around outside for hours just being ""in my head"" with all of my trauma. Some times I kinda deliberately trigger myself and seek out things that I know will hurt me by reminding me about the events. It's so strange because it obviously doesn't make me feel any better in any way shape or form. I don't know why I keep doing it.

I'm not really sure how to word everything when I meet with my psychologist our next session. I feel like it's hard to get understood. These points that I just brought up is what makes me think that it specifically isn't PTSD (even though I'm obviously very very affected by the traumatic events, that doesn't mean that it HAS to be PTSD).

Has anyone here dealt with any behaviours similar to this? How would I even describe all of this to my psychologist in the context of an evaluation for PTSD?

"I was just a kid CW: sexual abuse, regular abuse, pedophilia


I've been doing good, we haven't spoken since I was 15 and I'm 19 now. It's been 1300 ish days since I last had contact with him. Back then I thought he had just been abusive to me, I was still convinced that I had at least consented to some of it. But I didn't. I was 13. I don't care that he was only 15, only a year and some months older than me. I was 13. THIRTEEN. I was in E I G H T H grade. Back then I thought I looked older than I was. I always got mistaken for 15 or even 16. But that wasn't because I actually did. Ive looked at the photos from back then. I looked like a thirteen year old, I looked like a K I D. I WAS A FUCKING KID. WHY WAS I PLANNING OUT WHAT MY SEX LIFE WOULD BE WHEN I WAS AN ADULT. WHY WAS HE TELLING ME HE WANTED TO WATCH RANDOM GUYS FUCK ME. WHY WAS SO MUCH HINGED UPON ME NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS HAPPENING SEXUALLY. BEING FILMED. WHY WAS I TALKING ABOUT FILMING MYSELF TO POST RIGHT WHEN I TURNED 18. I wasn't a slut. I wasn't a whore. I was a CHILD. It hurts so much. I have been in therapy since I was 12 and this has been a focus of it since I was 14. I'm still not okay. I still find myself crying because of if and just feeling awful. I talk myself out of saying what he was trying to do. He never succeeded so I have no proof. When my mom first told me what she thought since she believed I hadn't spoken to him in months after she took my phone and he lived across the country I went upstairs to the Skype call he was on and told him. When I think about it. Neither he nor his mother denied it. They brought up that it was racist of my mom and the reason she found phone numbers for different countries was because his dad was from Bangladesh and they go to a Russian dentist. They said it was crazy and how dare she think that. But his mom also said so many things that felt so weird. When I told her he was trying to kill himself because I had moved on she sent me ""😘"" while thanking me, she often told him I was cute, she'd go into his room while he slept, he would guilt me into being on a call with him 24/7, with my camera on, and to sleep naked. Id often when he was taking a nap if I was up I'd see her walk in and start looking at his phone. As if she was checking if I was awake. He saved my nudes. And I know he didn't delete them after we broke up. I was 13 in most of those pictures, barely 14 in the rest. Why was a 14 year old an exhibitionist that wanted to be filmed during sex and have people watching. That's not normal. None of it was normal and I know that. Everytime I think about it I remember how young I was. He made me feel worthless without him, when he broke up with me I begged him saying I didn't care if he abused me. I didn't even realize he had been already. And when he wanted me back I came crawling everytime even after I realized. It wasn't until 6 months ago I realized.

"Partner struggling, in hospital Hi there. My partner is currently in the hospital, we went in for a diabetic emergency but he is also in a pretty bad PTSD episode. He’s oriented to person, place, and time, but terrified of everything and just constantly dissociating. They aren’t discharging yet because even though the medical part is cleared up, he’s barely talking. Can only get out “I don’t feel safe”
Recently restarted on Cymbalta, and newly started on Geodon (off label reasons) 
Once we’re discharged, I likely need to look at getting him into an IOP/PHP day program because right now he is just constantly dissociating and cant take care of himself at all. I feel horrible having him stuck in a program dissociating, but I’ve not been working for a week now and I’m really stressing now.

"Dealing with older people who just don't understand... I'm a new Christian and honestly coming to Christ has helped me a lot with my symptoms of anxiety and depression. I've been diagnosed with PTSD for the past 13 years and I'm on disability. I've come a long way over the past year, I can go to church, I can be social when it comes to talking about scripture which I'm passionate about but I shy away with anything outside of that and I go to Bible study. It's taken months to get relatively comfortable with the people there and it's taken a lot of energy to do so. I was kinda proud of how far I've come. Until today.  
I had seen something online that bothered me, I brought it up to a church elder whom I trusted because I trusted his judgement and it kinda...devolved into a chastisement of not arguing with people online and that I have too much time on my hands, that I should go out and work to put my faith into practice and do physical labor instead of being at home all the time online and reading my Bible (which is one of the few things that I ACTUALLY enjoy anymore). It wrecked me because...I do put my faith into practice. It's how I've come as far as I have. I can agree with him that yeah, sometimes I get carried away with a discussion and get frustrated and argue with the person I'm talking to and I need to learn to step away from those conversations, but he just saw me offer time to help someone who's struggling yesterday... to imply that I don't put my faith into practice was hurtful. And then, the reason for this post here, he was pushing for me to work for free at the church during my free time to be of help and saying I need to do physical labor, and when I tried to explain to him I deal with anxiety due to PTSD he kinda brushed me off saying ""Oh we all deal with anxiety."" I tried to explain that I look a lot more put together than I really am, and he brushed it off again saying everyone is that way.  
I've run into similar issues with my aunt who is around his age (50's to 60's) does anyone else run into this issue where it seems older people don't understand the concept of mental illness? That it's not something you can just get over overnight? That when I tell him I deal with anxiety, he doesn't realize the effort it takes to just walk outside the door to go to church. I come home and I collapse because I'm so exhausted from the emotional and mental strain.  
I don't know. I'm just hurt and I don't think I'm going to go to him again for spiritual needs or comfort. I want to continue in my walk with God, so I'll put some emotional walls up with this guy specifically because I love my church and the other members and I love Bible study.

"New to this community. Need help and any stories of success. Hello. My name is Jeff. I've been battling PTSD, Persistent Depressive Disorder, Night Terrors, Insomnia and Post Concussion Syndrome since 2015. I have exhausted all of the pharmaceutical treatments. I have been an Psychiatric Inpatient 5 times anywhere from 3 days to 6 months. Received 22 Electro Convulsive Therapy unilaterally with no success. I am about to start up 42 more ECT's over 14 weeks, this time bilaterally. The chances of moderate memory loss is in the cards. I figure what the hell. Better being forgetful than dead. I have been followed by the Concussion Legacy Foundation which is affiliated with Boston Medical Center who have given me a living diagnosis of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy using an Alzeimers blood draw for biomarkers, symptoms and history. Suffered 20 Concussions over 15 years of Triple AAA hockey and Select soccer. Played on 3 teams every winter and summer for each. An athlete during the 1970's and mid 1980's. Missing a shift was not an option even after suffering most if these Concussions mid game/match. Ketamine IV Infusion will be my last attempt at living a simplefied life. I've tried medical cannabis with no luck. Even cannabis pills, Nabilone, at max dosages didn't help. I'm not sure if I have it in me to continue. I have 42 ECT treatments scheduled over the next 14 weeks at a cost of $9 000 in round trip medical transit. Then I require a Personal Service Worker for 24 hours after each treatment to observe me at a total cost of $25 000 in wages. I don't know how much more fight is left in this old dog. My 3 wonderful children are the ONLY reason I'm still here.

"DAE have a disproportionately strong response to hurt animals? My PTSD has nothing to do with animals, but I was wondering if it might have something to do with how I respond to them.

I am not easily triggered for the most part. I gained a reputation for being a bit of a tough guy. I can handle hearing, seeing or dealing with all sorts of awful things (everything from intense violence, to infected injuries, to dementia patients) without being too bothered by it.

But anything involving hurt animals... That's an entirely different thing.

I'm currently shaken from reading a non-graphic post someone wrote about losing her dog. All I can think of is the sheer horror, both of her and the dog.

I once got hired to do some design work on a children's book that mentioned an in-universe-fictional cat dying. Even within the story they weren't real! And I still cried uncontrollably through the 4 hours of working on that thing.

It doesn't even need to be death or serious injury. I have to bring an emotional support human with me whenever I take my cat to the vet, because she is so stressed and I cannot.

Pretty much nothing else gets this kind of a response from me.

"My boyfriend has ptsd and I want to understand how to help him better. Before I started dating my boyfriend, he informed me that he had PTSD and that it affected the way he acted sometimes. I told him I understood and immediately began doing research, but a week ago I caught myself slipping up because I had honestly forgotten he had it (he never mentioned it after that and that was months ago). We were in an argument and I asked him how he wanted me to help him and he just told me he was going to “shut down.” This upset me a lot, but then I remembered that it could possibly be linked to his PTSD. He always tells me he feels disconnected from the world, and I can tell because he really does act this way. He seems to have an emotional disconnect from everyone around him. When we go out in public I am mostly the one that does the talking, he just tends to stare down at his feet. And he does tend to just shut down during stressful times, hes even admitted that he has a hard time trusting me despite wanting to, which kind of hurt. I don’t mind any of this of course, I just want to be a better girlfriend to him and help him, I don’t want him to feel disconnected but I’m well aware that there is probably nothing I can specifically do to help this as it is his mental illness and he would need to change his treatment for it.

"How do you politely ask someone to fuck off and give you space? I intentionally shop at grocery stores where I know there will be a self checkout. I can’t stand in congested lines or have people staring at me. I try to do grocery pickups but sometimes I shop later at night.
I shop at a store and every single time I try to choose a self checkout as far away from the worker standing around as possible. Every single fucking time they find some excuse to mosey behind me, right on my asshole or at the register next to me. I completely understand they are monitoring people, but standing just inches behind me is completely unnecessary. I usually use my cart to create space between us and stare at them so they can maybe get the message that they’re standing way too fucking close in my breathing space. I have PTSD from violence and when people get too close I go into both a panic and rage. I do *not* like when someone is standing behind me and I can’t see them. When I was walking in a worker was gathering carts and was walking very quickly behind me, matching my speed. It freaked me out (I walk fast and was trying to walk away from this person, it felt like I was being chased. I wasn’t, but I have PTSD and nothing is reasonable anymore) and I was already in a panicky mood at the store. 

I’ve worked retail and at a grocery store. I don’t know how I would feel if a customer told me I was too close to them. A lot of these workers are older women and frankly have no sense of physical boundary. I’m tired of crying in my car. I’m on an SSRI for anxiety but it doesn’t help with social situations. The only thing that helps is lorazepam, which I don’t like taking daily or if I don’t truly need it. However it does make me more direct with people, which is good. 

I’m just so tired of these workers not respecting my space. I’ll literally watch them pretend to check on something just to stand next to my register. Like there are cameras. Fuck off. 

Sorry but I also just needed to rant somewhere. Having PTSD is devastating. This woman unknowingly standing too close to me legit ruined my night. This shit isn’t fair.

"Flashbacks Sorry if this is triggering for anyone.
I'll give yall the short version cause I really don't want to get into it.
I was abused by my mother physically, emotionally and alienated against everyone and her family didnt believe me.
I was abused emotionally by my first boyfriend and his parents, then we moved out I got pregnant and he r---d me 2 weeks after my emergency c-section because he was ""entitled to it cause you're mine and you're not allowed to say no to me."" And I was then abused for a further year and a bit because I stopped loving him, loved our child more (god forbid??) Just stopped putting effort into him.  So when I left him, he forced me out, stopped me seeing my 1 year old baby and I had no support from social services, family, police and it was during covid so going to court took extra long and by then, I was inly given visitation because ""she wouldn't have known me"" so it was to reintroduce us. He refused that even though it was court ordered so I'm having to take him back to court.
I dated someone else who abused me and it was just a horrid experience.
I've since cut ties with my ""family"" and changed my surname. I've not seen my daughter in years because I tried giving him chances and tried getting my mental health in a better place because I had a full blown mental break down over it all. I also tried a contraceptive injection which fucked with my hormones, weight, mental health, everything.
I was raped in May this year, when I was in a shared house and I was locked in my room by him. He's still in the run now and im in a temp accommodation.
Now I'm happily single, I'm the happiest I've ever been, in spite of what happened in May, I have a solicitor and I'm going back to court for my daughter and everything's going alright.

"How do I stop being so angry at my brain? I stopped therapy a little while ago after 3 years of it. I feel a lot better and have less symptoms than I did before.

It affects my whole life, but mainly work, where I find I get frustrated at everyone and everything. It happens less than it did before, maybe 1-2 times a month, so it's usually manageable.

"CW: gun violence, mass shootings, physical abuse, stalking I'm really struggling right now after hearing about the most recent school shooting.  I can't breathe.

He just started hitting me with a wooden brick and trying to bash my head in.  I had bruises on my arms from blocking the attacks but nothing was ever done because ""he had anger issues"".

"Trauma from Abusive Relationship  I am consumed by an overwhelming wave of emotions that I can’t seem to escape. The memories of my past relationship have resurfaced, bringing with them a cocktail of anger, guilt, sympathy, and deep-seated trauma. I find myself haunted by images of moments where both of us were hurt—times when I was wrong and times when she was wrong. It’s like a dark cloud that won’t lift, making me question why this relationship ever happened, why we both had to suffer so much, and why I am left with these scars that feel impossible to heal.

In our relationship, there were countless moments where I felt suffocated by her overwhelming need for attention, her constant sensitivity, and her inability to let the smallest things go. She would beg for my time, my affection, and my presence, and I remember feeling trapped, unable to even have a moment for myself. I know that I hurt her deeply, sometimes without meaning to, but my words cut like knives—words that were harsher than any physical pain, stabbing deeper than I ever intended. And yet, in those moments, I felt powerless, caught in a cycle of hurt and blame that neither of us could escape.

There were times when she would cry so hard she could barely breathe, and those moments are etched into my mind. I feel haunted by the memory of her pain—pain that I caused, but also pain that came from her own actions. It’s as if we were both caught in this toxic dance, unable to break free, each of us hurting the other in ways we never deserved. It was like we were two different kinds of broken people, trapped in a relationship that became a battlefield. We both hurt each other so much, and now, I am left feeling the weight of all that anger, regret, and sadness.

I feel like I am both the villain and the victim in this story. I’m struggling to come to terms with how I could have been so toxic and hurtful, yet also deeply hurt myself. I carry the guilt of being someone who has caused another person to break down, and at the same time, I am carrying my own trauma—memories that feel like wounds that will never heal. I don’t know how to forgive myself for the mistakes I made, for the words I said, or for the times when I wasn’t there for her when she needed me. I don’t know how to forgive her for the ways she suffocated me, for the times she made me feel like nothing I did was ever enough.

I wish I could just erase it all. I wish I could go back and undo the past, to a time when none of this happened, when we never met, never fell in love, and never went through all this pain. I feel cursed, like I am being punished for something I can’t even understand—whether it’s some kind of karma for my past actions or just a cruel twist of fate. Sometimes, I wonder if I deserve all of this because of the person I used to be, the mistakes I made, the times I rejected God, and how I lived with anger and defiance. It’s as if all of this suffering is retribution for the person I once was.

But beyond all the guilt and the blame, there’s a deeper question that torments me: why? Why did this relationship have to happen? Why did we have to meet, only to tear each other apart in the end? Why did it have to be so toxic, so damaging, so traumatic? Why couldn’t I just have a normal, peaceful life without these scars? I feel like I’m drowning in these questions, and there are no answers that bring me peace.

I feel like my innocence has been stolen from me, that life has turned me into someone I never wanted to be. I used to be someone who felt deeply, who was moved by the world, and now I feel numb, disconnected, and almost robotic. I wish I could be a monk, emotionless, unattached, so I would never have to feel this kind of pain again. I wish I could be numb to everything because the hurt is too much to bear. I don’t want to feel anymore because all it has brought me is suffering.

I’m tired of this pain that feels endless and relentless. I’m tired of feeling like the villain and the victim, of carrying this guilt, anger, and trauma with me every day. I just wish I could be free from it all, that I could have a life where none of this ever happened. I’m struggling to understand why life has turned out this way, why I have to carry this burden, and why I can’t just live a simple, peaceful life like everyone else.

This is the pain I’m feeling right now. I feel broken, haunted, and utterly lost. I hope you can help me find a way to make sense of it all, or at least find a way to live with it.",-1.0,ptsd

"NSFW: [Sexual Abuse] Struggling Years Later  




I don't know if I went past the rules my deepest apologies if so









Howdy Yall, for a quick backstory leaving most of it vauge as I don't wanna start hyperfixing on it. 

My mother left my father at 14 for a prison inmate (still incarnated) and for awhile it didn't bug me never blame full fault on him my father's love language is detached (for reference they were about 15 Years apart) had my oldest at 21 and he was slowing down as he was 53 and just wanted to slow down and be a homebody. She just constantly stated how she didn't feel loved and didn't want to die feeling alone as her mother did (fair enough) at that time, I was just panicking as I didn't want anyone to end up alone/feeling unloved as I didn't really have anyone else in my life.



It took a turn when she made me go to the prison to visit him for the first few visits nothing happened, made the joke to call him Step-Stab to his face (stabbed a dude 56 times in the chest, attractive am i right) it slowly got to the point since partners can't sit together due to explicit actions(as inmates with children sat in the back area and 90% of the time there was no other people and the guard sat in the front there was a small divider) . I got used as the relief for lack of a better term while sitting in the back of the visitation room which went on for about 2-3 years, every time she came over I could smell something, I dont know how to describe it. I remember alot but the one is when she woke me up and was surprised i was wearing clothes, she thought i slept naked (her phone was out) then asked if i had any photos from the lake. She would also write letter to him from me which im guessing fueled the sexual shit. till I was at a forensics meet in Junior year I had a panic attack and when I got to the hospital to get ass juiced I spilled the beans. I want to move past this but occasionally I feel some form of anger towards her I live halfway across multiples states away and I still feel fear especially now that he's technically free.

"does anyone else trip out after social engagements? whenever i get home from seeing people - 2 people, 20 people, doesn’t matter - i ruminate and get paranoid over what i said, what they said, whether they meant what they said, whether what i said was taken how i meant it or if i came off in a way i didn’t intend. 

it’s torturous and makes me not want to see people, except i know i need to see people and have community and friends and support.

"Physical Symptoms As A Result Of PTSD Minor, diagnosed with PTSD last year as a result of family problems, which is not the topic of this post. First-time poster, recent-lurker. I haven't really had any reason to use Reddit nor peruse it, but I could use some like-minded folks' help.

  
When I was diagnosed, I thought it was going to be the standard, stereotypical stuff; memories, nightmares, anxiety attacks and the like. I fall under enough of these categories to be professionally diagnosed, but I exhibited some additional symptoms as well that I hadn't really had the time to talk to my therapist about in depth, like if this was common or anything. My dad is unemployed and I cannot currently ask for a lot of help from her without being charged. While I'm entirely supported and my therapist and I are confident I can spend time away, it's also been hard given this is the longest I've gone without professional help since my mom was still living with us.

  
Anyhow, I've always wondered if anyone with the diagnosis has experienced any of the following symptoms:

- Extreme to moderate dizziness & nausea upon enduring a trigger (will/can last days to weeks.)

- Vomiting upon enduring a trigger

- Going entirely mute for hours to days (although this has only happened once)

- Similar, recurrent nightmares of things that have never happened to me, or at least to my memory

- Extreme weakness and fatigue post-trigger

  
It isn't much, and I know people can and will experience variants of some of these, but I'm mostly looking for anyone who's experienced dizzy spells. It's come up with several triggers, least often with ones that hardly relate to me and confuse me to no end. Is this also an experience for some?

  
Thanks for taking the time to read this(?). I dont know how to end a post :-(",1.0,ptsd
"Ever feel shocked by how much time has passed  I (29f) often feel bewildered when I think about a person, conversation, or event and then realize how long ago it was. Even if it’s not traumatic.

Am I the only one that has a messed up sleep schedule? I haven’t been able to sleep for six months after the incident. (In terms of nights. I’ll stay up until 8AM and then sleep due to exhaustion.)

"Am I having flashbacks? How do I prevent or lessen them? TW: mentions SH urges, TLDR at the end 

I don't like saying I have flashbacks because it's not really a flashback. I don't think. I don't believe I'm actually there, or that it's happening again. But I feel the same emotions I felt while it was happening. And in that moment, it feels like I zone out. But again, it's not like I'm actually *there.* I'm just.... not in reality, I'm stuck in the remembrance of the events. 

I feel fear, guilt, regret, embarrassment, shame, and all the other emotions that won't leave me. When I remember the events, my body will often jerk suddenly. Like when you're sleeping and ""fall,"" then wake up. Why does this happen? Sometimes I involuntarily hit myself or dig my nails into my skin. I don't want to do this but I feel an innate need to rid myself of what's happening. 

Lately, the memories have been coming up constantly. And memories that didn't bother me before, bother me a lot now. Everything reminds me of them. It's gotten to the point where just feeling my general anxiety fucking reminds me of my laundry list of trauma. 

I don't know how much longer I can do this. Not in the suicidal way but I'm panicking. When things are especially bad, all I want to do is SH. I haven't had cutting urges for *so long.* All my scars are completely healed and white but they are a constant reminder of what I want to do. The worst part is the *only* reason I'm not cutting is bc I often change clothes in front of my roommate and it would be suspicious if I suddenly wasn't comfortable doing that. Bc he'd obviously see the wounds and I don't want to hurt him like that.....

Please help me. I just need tips to stay clean rn I'm reaching a breaking point 

TLDR: I'm having recurring traumatic memories and self harming urges. How do I lessen the severity of obsessive trauma thoughts? What coping skills keep you from cutting/self harming? But more importantly, what motivates you to stay clean from sh?  ",-1.0,ptsd
"Broken object = Break down Every time I break something I get very emotional over it. Every single time I cry. Sometimes a lot, sometimes a little depending on the situation. I never knew why until I brought it up to my mom. She said so casually that “it’s probably because of me”. Meaning when I was little she explained to me that she’d get angry if I broke something.

"Body freezing  This person i dated 8 years ago contacted me, said they were visiting my town and wanted to possibly hang out.

I said maybe a friendly lunch, that I wasn't interested in anything romantic or sexual. He agreed yes a friendly lunch.

So we go on the lunch and after the lunch he is angry I am no longer interested in him. Says it doesn't make sense. 

I got super triggered by his anger and tensed up. He tried to hold my hand but I was frozen by then.

 My hand was flat and would not open. He started trying to pry my fingers apart but couldn't I was too stiff. He mentioned that my shoulder was contorted while I was frozen.

Anyway just wanted to learn more about what my body was doing with the freezing, stiffening and contorting. If that makes sense, I am tired right now and not explaining myself well ",1.0,ptsd

Isn’t that enough? This world has gone crazy and all I can do is sit and watch as people argue over the most trivial things or complain about spilt milk, while I’ve been through the most intense and traumatic shit possible.

I was in preschool/ kindergarten ( I don’t remember but it was one of those) when the teacher made me and my classmates sit by the bathroom door on the floor (the door was open) and the teachers made us go to the bathroom, which I’m pretty sure is normal, what I think is not normal however was what they did next. They made us use the restroom and get undressed, with the door open while every student watched, I was nervous, very self conscious and confused, ( I sat there using the bathroom while every student saw me nu*de and me looking them in the eyes, because all of them were staring,I’m mentioning this to try and describe how uncomfortable it all was for not only me, but my other classmates )even at that time not knowing what was happening fully, I still felt confused and nervous. Other kids were made to use the bathroom as well while everyone watched, that was the first time seeing nud*ity at that age. They didn’t separate girls or boys either, I’m a girl and I was forced to see a boy’s genitalia, I felt odd, like I was the one in the wrong.  The teachers( there was either 1 or 2 of them)  just stood and watched as well. So I’m just wondering am I being over dramatic over absolutely nothing? Was what I described normal in preschools or elementary? ",-1.0,ptsd
"Maintaining friendships while having PTSD It really sucks when you look back at all of the friendships you’ve lost and see a common denominator in every single one of them.

"Victim blaming or accountability? trigger warning: talk of being roofied

Hello, not a big Reddit user so please excuse if formatted incorrectly. I’ll get to the point of this post, I was severely injured after an incident where all clues lead to me being roofied, textbook symptoms. I was sitting at a table with a trusted girlfriend where we were talking with some new guests at the establishment. I needed to excuse myself briefly and gave her my drink to watch over as we had done several times before for each other. Fast forward many injuries and hospital stays later, I was released to my parents care as I needed around the clock assistance. My parents meant well I think? But essentially blamed me for leaving my drink in the care of someone else and this was the consequences of my own actions, and I’m lucky I didn’t die (The last bit being 1000% true). Am I in denial or is that victim blaming?

"False Memories and People who Don't Exist  I -for a lot of reasons- have very awful memories. Ptsd,OCD, anxiety, etc. 

I found out I remember someone who never existed -according to everyone I know-. When I was 13 I remembered having a friend who was 11 (maybe 12), we went to school together and texted a bit after school. We ever got back in touch a few years out of school but then I randomly brought her up and everyone I told about her said this girl ""doesn't sound familiar"". I pushed the topic further because this confused me then my BF (who would've knew about the texts) said I never talked with a girl like that. I'm a very anxious person so I decided to go back in my year book to show him proof and found that there aren't any pictures of her.
